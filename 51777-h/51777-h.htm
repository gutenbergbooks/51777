<h2 class="p2">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="wn">THE BEAN ISLAND PEOPLE.</span></h2>

<p class="pp10q p1">“O Tam! hadst thou but been sae wise<br />
As ta’en thy ain wife Kate’s advice!”</p>
<p class="pr4">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Tam O’Shanter.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> was April, 1876, and Deacon Atwood and Captain
Black were riding along the sandy highway in the sparsely
settled vicinity of Bean Island, in the State of South Carolina.</p>

<p>Though the sun shone uncomfortably hot, neither the
men nor the horses they bestrode seemed anxious to escape
its rays, for they traveled quite leisurely several miles,
till they reached a point where the road forked.</p>

<p>There they paused a few moments, and continued their
conversation in the same low, earnest tones they had previously
employed.</p>

<p>The Deacon was fifty years of age, large, broad-chested,
red-faced, with full fiery red beard and thin brown hair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
which gathered in sodden, tapering hanks about his short
neck and large ears; and his pale-blue eyes looked out of
little triangular orifices on either side of a pyramidal nose,
upon the apex of which was balanced a narrow forehead
of a “quirked ogee” pattern. His hands were large and
freckled, and he kept them in constant motion, like his
huge feet, which seemed even too heavy for his clumsy
legs. His snuff-colored suit, and the slouched hat he wore
on the back part of his head, were dusty with travel.</p>

<p>His companion was younger, taller, and less stoutly built
than he. His eyes were large and dark, and his head,
crowned with bushy black hair, was poised upon a long,
slim neck. His manners indicated more culture than the
Deacon had received.</p>

<p>“Well, Deacon,” said he, rising in his stirrups, “we have
submitted long enough, and too long, and there must be a
change: and I am bound to do my share to secure it.”</p>

<p>“And I won’t be behind yo’, Cap’n,” replied Deacon Atwood.
“These niggers must be put down where they
belong, and the carpet-baggers driven back where they
came from.”</p>

<p>“It’s doubtful whether many of them would be received
there. I apprehend that the most of them “left their
country for their country’s good” when they came here.
A man don’t emigrate for nothing, and I expect they have
been run out of the North for some mean acts, and have
come to the South to prey upon a conquered people.”</p>

<p>“I reckon that’s so, and I wonder how yo’ men that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
’a’n’t no church obligations on yo’ ken keep from swearing
when yo’ think of it. I declar, when I get to turning it
over in my mind I get so mad that I can’t hardly keep
from it myself. As yo’ war saying, it reaches everywhere.
Less than half the people is white to be sure, but then we
own nine-tenths o’ the land, and yet we must be taxed to
support nigger schools, and niggers and carpet-baggers in
all the offices, and new offices trumped up where there a’n’t
enough to serve them as wants ’em&mdash;health officers in every
little town, and scavengers even, under pretense of fear of
yellow fever, to give salaries to dumb niggers as don’t
know nothing only how to rob Southern gentlemen, and all
sorts of yankee “public improvements” as they call ’em!
Why, I’m taxed this year to mend a road that runs down
past me there, and nobody but niggers never travels on it.
It is positively insulting and oppressive!”</p>

<p>“Well, Deacon, I suppose your statement that niggers
and carpet-baggers are in all the offices might be called a
slight exaggeration, but then we could sit here till dark
and not finish enumerating the grievances this State government,
backed by that Cæsar Grant, at Washington,
imposes upon the people of South Carolina&mdash;those that
ought to be the ruling class&mdash;the South Carolinians.</p>

<p>“But the best thing we can do is to take hold of these
military clubs and work them; and in that way bring about
a better state of things. I, for one, am determined this
State shall go Democratic this coming fall; and if we unite
in this method I’ve been explaining to you, we can effect it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Just bring this Mississippi method up in your club to-night&mdash;or
support Lamb, if he does&mdash;and we’ll whip the rascals.
Nigger voters are too thick&mdash;must be weeded out!”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I’m going to do,” replied Deacon Atwood;
“and in order to do it, I reckon we’ll have to go
on.”</p>

<p>“Yes; my sabre club meets this evening, too, for drill.
So good evening!”</p>

<p>“Good evening, Captain.” And the two men separated.
The Captain kept the main road, and the Deacon took a
sort of back, plantation route, seldom traveled except by
the farmers residing upon it, where he soon fell into deep
meditation, his chin dropping upon his breast, and his respiration
becoming slow and heavy. His old white horse,
even, seeming to pass into a similar state of somnambulency,
walked dreamily along, till his nose, far down
towards the ground, came in contact with a fresh and tender
shrub, around which his long tongue instinctively
wrapped itself, and he came to a full stop.</p>

<p>“Hud up!” said the startled Deacon, gathering up his
bridle with a nervous jerk; and his small eyes quickly
swept a circle around him.</p>

<p>With something like a shudder and an audible sigh of
relief, he composed himself again, for only a quiet landscape
had met his vision.</p>

<p>A swampy forest was on his left hand, and long stretches
of scrub palmettos, interspersed with cotton-patches, on his
right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing two colored men at work in one of the latter, and
probably feeling a need of human companionship, he rode
up to the crooked rail fence, and shouted “Howdy?”</p>

<p>“Why, howdy? Deacon, howdy?” was the friendly response,
as one of the men laid down his heavy cotton hoe,
and approached the fence.</p>

<p>“How is work, January?” asked Deacon Atwood, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“I gets along mighty well, I thank yo’. I hope yo’ do,”
said the freedman, who, though about the age of his neighbor,
was too much accustomed to being addressed as a boy,
and by his Christian name, to take offense at the familiarity.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be blamed if yo’ niggers don’t get along better’n
the white folks! These confounded carpet-baggers
are larnin’ yo’ how to fleece us that owns the land, and
blowed if yo’ ain’t doing it!”</p>

<p>“Why, Deacon, I don’t know what yo’ mean. I ha’n’t
been fleecing nobody, I’m shor’. If God Almighty gives
me my freedom, and gives me strength to work what land
I’m able, and makes the crops grow, why ha’n’t I a right
to get ’long? I can’t see who’s hurt, not to my serious
knowledge?”</p>

<p>“It a’n’t yo’r working, it’s yo’r voting. Yo’ vote them
villains into office, and they’re bleeding the country to
death with taxes. Now, we a’n’t gwine to stand it. All the
gentleman has agreed together that yo’ve got to come
over to our side. It’s for yo’r interest to be thar.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“Can’t do it, nohow, Deacon,” replied the negro, smiling
good-humoredly.</p>

<p>“If yo’ don’t there’ll lots of yo’ be killed,” said Deacon
A., kindling.</p>

<p>“Now, Deacon Atwood,” said January Kelly, deliberately,
“I think a parcel of gentleman that was raised and
been college-bred, men that would undertake to ride over
things by killing out a few niggers&mdash;well, I think its a very
small idea for an educated man. I think they must have
lost all conscience of heart; I think all conscience of heart
are gone when they come to do that, <i>I do</i>; but you a’n’t in
earnest, Deacon? You’re a Christian man. I ha’nt got
<i>no neighbors</i> as would hurt me. I’m a honest man as
works hard, and minds my own business, and takes care o’
my family; and nobody ain’t gwoine to kill me, nohow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, January; nobody won’t hurt honest, hard-working
darkies like you, if they let politics alone; but
then there’ll be lots of the leaders be killed, ’fo’ election, if
just such men as yo’ don’t come over and help us save
the State,” said the Deacon.</p>

<p>“Why the State is all here. I don’t see as it’s lost, nor
gwoine to smash, either; and if we have a Government
we’ve got to have leaders. If all the men stayed to home
and worked land like I do, there wouldn’t be no Government.”</p>

<p>“So much the better,” snapped the Deacon. “The strong
could take care of themselves and look out for the weak
ones too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about that. The rogues would
steal and kill all the same, and who’d take care of our lives
and our property, and collect the taxes, and build the
bridges the war burned down, and the school-houses, and
pay the teachers, and all them things?”</p>

<p>“There is too many of them now; and South Carolinians
shall rule South Carolina!” broke forth Deacon Atwood, with
great vehemence; “and I want you to come over to the
democratic party where you won’t get hurt. We’ll all help
you if you will.”</p>

<p>“Why Deacon, I thought yo’ was just saying we is
getting along the best. I was born in South Car’lina, an’
so was mos’ all the collud people in the State to-day, and
ain’t we South Carolinians then? Now all I has got to say
is, <i>that it’s a mighty mean man as won’t stand to his own</i>.
It war the ’publican party as made me a free man, an’ I
reckon I shall vote ’publican <i>long as I breaves</i>! That is
all I can say, Deacon. I don’t know no mo’.”</p>

<p>“Hud up!” said the Deacon, and he rode abruptly away.</p>

<p>“What on earth has come over Deacon Atwood, I wonder,”
said Mr. Kelley, to a tall, muscular black man, who,
swinging his hoe lazily, had at length planted his row
abreast with the spot where his employer had dropped his
when the Deacon saluted him.</p>

<p>“Talking ’bout politics, I reckon!” was the drawling
reply.</p>

<p>“Yes, and he did make some awful threats! Why,
Pompey, he said they’d lots of the niggers ’round here get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
killed ’fo’ election if we didn’t come ovah to the democratic
party! Now I’ve hearn that kind o’ talk ever since reconstruction,
but I never did, myself, hear the Deacon, nor no
such ’spectable and ’ligious men talk it ’fo’; though they
say they did talk it, an’ gone done it, too, in some places.
He says it’s a general thing now, from shor’ to shor’ this
time ’mong the gem’men. He says the taxes is ruining the
country, an’ niggers an’ carpet-baggers is in all the offices,
an’ the money is wasted, an’ there’s got to be a change.”</p>

<p>“Oh, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; him! It’s just the odder way about&mdash;shutting
up offices&mdash;doing away wid ’em, an’ turning de
niggahs out to make room for old confederate soldiers! I
hearn Kanrasp, an’ Striker, an’ Rathburn, an’ some o’ them
big fellahs talkin’ ’bout it dar in Aiken.”</p>

<p>(Pompey had boarded in a certain public institution at
the county seat for the greater safety of the contents of
market-wagons in the town where he resided.)</p>

<p>“The land mos’ all b’longs to the white folks, sho nuff,
an’ the rent is so awful high that a nigger has got to work
hisself an’ his family mos’ to death to keep from gittin’
inter debt to de boss, let alone a decent livin’, an’ now the
gem’men is bound to resist the taxes fo’ the schools, so our
chillun can’t have no schools. I thinks it’s toughest on
our side!” said Kelley.</p>

<p>“Kanrasp said de Governor is doin’ splendid,” continued
Pompey, “cuttin’ down expenses so dey is a gwoine to
save a million an’ seventeen hundred an’ nineteen thousand
dollars an’ mo’ in one year; or he did save it last year.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>(Pompey had a memory for numbers, though neither gift
nor training for mathematical calculations.)</p>

<p>“Striker, he was mad cause de Governor made ’em put
down an’ print just ebberyting wouldn’t let ’em buy no
“sundies” or somethings&mdash;I do’nt know. De white folks
wouldn’t let de niggers have no money in old slave times,
an’ now dis Governor Chamberlain dat ’tends to be a ’publican,
he makes de nigger an’ de Legislature men as come
from de North be mighty careful dey don’t get no cent o’
de white folk’s taxes ’thout printing jes’what it’s all
boughtened.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, that’s right and honest like,” replied Kelly,
“‘cause they’ve been thieves don’t make it right for us to
steal; and then the niggers pays taxes, too, and don’t ort to
be cheated neither; and I’d like to know if them ways don’t
make the taxes easier? They do say they was a mighty
sight o’ stealin’ from the treasury going on thar in Columbya
a while ago. I reckon Governer Chamberlain is a honest
man, and don’t steal hisself neither.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, de taxes is easier. Lawyer Crafty, dar in
Aiken&mdash;he’s a democrat too, you know&mdash;he joined in de
talk some, and he said it is easier’n it was; fo’ de taxes
used to be thirteen or sixteen mills on a dollar (if yo’ know
what dat means), but now it is only eleven.”</p>

<p>“I don’t prezackly understood it,” said Kelly, “but I
know eleven ain’t so much as thirteen nor sixteen; and I do
reckon it makes it easier. I reckon it’s mo’ cause the white
folks wants all the money and the offices theirselves, as
makes the fuss.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” drawled Pompey, “and dey makes any man a
carpet-bagger dat wa’n’t baun in de South, an’ some ’publicans
as was. De Governor has been in de State, an’ all he’s
got, now ’leven year; Kanrasp said so; an’ Cummings&mdash;de
head teacher o’ de big school in Columby&mdash;de Versity dey
calls it&mdash;he’s been in de South thirty year an’ mo’; an’ dey calls
him a carpet-bagger, too, an’ all his boys; but de boys was
baun here. But den dey is ’publicans an’ teaches niggers,
too, I wonder is dey any carpet-baggers up North or anywhere?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I never did hear tell of ’em; but the No’th
beat in the wa’, you know. But ’bout this killin’ niggers;
I’m a thinken, the Lo’d knows we has had enough o’ that:
but I can’t help thinking,” said Kelly, and the two men entered
into a long conversation upon the subject which we
will not follow, as our present interest is with Deacon Atwood,
who had resumed his way with Kelly’s quaint and
expressive phrase “must have lost all conscience of heart,”
as his constant and sole companion, for he had not yet
“lost <i>all</i> conscience of heart.”</p>

<p>Arrived at home, he ate his evening meal in haste and
silence, and immediately set out for the hall where his Rifle
Club met, accompanied by his eldest son, who was a minor
by a few months.</p>

<p>Mrs. A. shouted after him, admonishing to an early return,
as she did “detest these night meetings, anyhow.”</p>

<p>The father and son rode in silence, while the short Southern
twilight faded, and night settled upon the picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
landscape, soft as the brooding wing of peace; and balmy
breezes rustled through the gigantic long-leaved pines and
mammoth live-oaks, and over fields of sprouting corn and
cotton; and the dark soil seemed to sleep calmly and sweetly
under the white moonlight and a sprinkling of white
sand, which sparkled like snow.</p>

<p>“Watson, my son,” said the Deacon at length.</p>

<p>“Yes, father.”</p>

<p>An ominous silence warned the boy of a weighty communication
forthcoming.</p>

<p>“I’d rather yo’d ’a ’staid to home to-night, but as I’d
promised yo’ going, it couldn’t be helped. I reckon we’ll
have an exciting time, but now as yo’ are a going, <i>try to
keep cool</i>. Like enough thar’ll be some things said that
better not; but as yo’ll be present, now mind what I say,
and keep cool. Try to be careful. Don’t get excited nor be
imprudent. It’ll do for us to foller the rest. Just let them
take the lead and the responsibility.”</p>

<p>“Well, father,” replied the youth demurely, well knowing
that his cautious parent would be the first tinder to take
fire and lead any conflagration that might be imminent.</p>

<p>It is not to our purpose to report the doings of that political
Rifle Club’s meeting&mdash;the stirring speeches of citizens
of the State, who forgot that they were also citizens of the
Nation against which their treasonable resolutions were
moved, discussed, and voted; nor the inflammatory harangues
of Deacon Atwood; nor the courageous utterances of one
little man of broader intelligence and views than his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
neighbors, who urged that the coming political campaign
be prosecuted in a fair, straightforward, lawful and honest
manner, which should command respect everywhere, and
convince the hitherto intractable colored voters that their
former masters were disposed to accept the situation resultant
upon the war, and with their support, reconstruct the
politics of the State upon a basis of mutual interests, in
place of the antagonism of races which had prevailed ever
since the emancipation and enfranchisement of the slaves.</p>

<p>While these discussions relieved over-accumulations of
eloquence and over-wrought imaginations, they also disclosed
the true state of feeling, and the deep smouldering
embers of bitterness that once “fired the Southern heart” to
fratricidal war.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, good and calming counsels often gain
least by interchange of expression with those of passion,
and so it came that young men, and men whose years should
have brought them ripe judgment, but did not, shuddered
the next morning at the recollection of words they had
uttered, and decisions made in that club-room, from which
it would be difficult to recede.</p>

<p>Betrayed by his sanguine temperament and his implacable
foe&mdash;the love of strong drink&mdash;Deacon Atwood was
one of these.</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty pass when a man at yo’r time of life stays
out till two o’clock in the mornin’ drinkin’, and mercy
knows what, I do declar!” said Mrs. A. as she met her
liege lord at the door of their domicile, “And takin’ his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
only son out to initiate him, too, and yo’ a church officer.”</p>

<p>“Wh&mdash;wh&mdash;why didn’t yo’ go to bed, Ja&mdash;Ja&mdash;Janette,
I didn’t ex&mdash;ex&mdash;expect to find yo’ up.”</p>

<p>“No, I shouldn’t reckon yo’ did, judging by yo’ exes.
Making a fool and a beast o’ yo’self, and tempting yo’ son,
when we’ve been praying for his conversion so long.”</p>

<p>“Wal Ja&mdash;Janette, yo’ ’ort to ha’ prayed for me, too, fo’
I’ve made a ’nough sight mo’ fool o’ myself than Wat has o’
hissen. But I’ve been true to the State,” drawled and
stammered the Deacon, with thick and maudlin utterance,
“and if I could stand as much w’iskey as some on em, I’d
a’ been true to myself also. But who’s been here, Ja&mdash;Janette?”
Vainly trying to stand erect, and pointing
with nerveless finger to an armful of crooked sticks that
lay upon the blazing hearth. “Who brung ’em in?”</p>

<p>“It wa’n’t yo’, Deacon Atwood; I might ha’ froze to
death walking this house, and nigh fainting with fear,
thinking some nigger had outened yo’ smoke fo’ yo’ fo’
allus’ on this earth.” (He was fumbling in his pocket for an
old clay pipe he carried there.) “I do believe uncle Jesse
and aunt Phebe are the best Christians on this plantation.
Yo’r old mother took her toddy, and went to snoring
hours ago, thinking nothing o’ what might happen yo’&mdash;her
only son, who she’s dependent on to manage all her
thousand acres o’ land; though gracious knows I wish she’d
give yo’ a foot or two of it, without waiting to all eternity
fo’ her to die ’fo’ we can call an earthly thing our
own. I couldn’t get that story I hearn yo’ telling Den<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Bardon ’to’ther day, out o’ my head, and I war that scarred
I couldn’t go to bed.”</p>

<p>“What story was that?” asked Watson, as he hung his
whip and saddle upon a wooden peg in a corner of the
kitchen where the trio were.</p>

<p>“Why, about that Texas Jack that is around here, killing
niggers and everybody; and he don’t have more ’n a word
with a man till he shoots him down. If I had a knowed
yo’ was coming home tight, father, I’d a been scarred ’clar
to death shor’. A pretty mess yo’ll hev’ in the church
now, Deacon Atwood! Elder Titmouse’ll be after yo’
shor.”</p>

<p>“Hi, hi, hi,” laughed the Deacon. “Hic, a-hic, a-hic,
hi, hi. No danger o’ that, old gal. He’d have to be after
the whole church, and take the lead of the leaviners hisself.
He’s the Chaplain o’ the Club, and the d-r-u-n-kest
man in town to-night. The old bell-sheep jumped the
fence first, and helter skelter! all the flock jumped after
him. Hick, a-hic. But who, hic, taken that wood, hic,
from the yard, hic, and brung it thar?” demanded the
head o’ the house, with changed mood, ominous of a coming
domestic storm. “Dina’s gone, and Tom’s gone, and
yo’ wouldn’t do it if yo’ froze.”</p>

<p>“Wal, now, I was feeling powerful bad, a-walking the
house, and crying and praying mighty hard, and fust I
knowed I heard a humming and a singing, and who should
come up to the do’ but Aunt Phebe, and Uncle Jesse close
behind? They reckoned thar was sickness, and they come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to help. Now, I call that Christian, if they be niggers.
“Why yo’re freezing,” says Uncle Jess, “and yo’ll git the
fever.” So he brung the wood and made the fire, and we
all prayed for <i>yo’</i>, a heap mo’n yo’re worth; fo’, as I say, I
war a thinking o’ Texas Jack. When we heahed ole Duke
whinny they went home, and this minute they’ve blowed
their light out.”</p>

<p>“Hi! hi! Old gal, we’ve been <i>making</i> Texas Jacks&mdash;setting
’em up all night; and they’ll be thicker ’n bumble
bees and yaller jackets ’fo’ ’lection. But they don’t know
how to kill nobody but radicals&mdash;niggers and carpet-baggers
and scalawags.”</p>

<p>“Now, Deacon, if yo’ve been setting up anything agin
such men as Jesse and Den, and Penny Loo, I just hope
yo’ll git chawed up by yo’re own Jacks?” said this Southern
aristocratic female Christian, in great ire.</p>

<p>“No danger o’ Texas Jack’s hurting <i>me</i>. He won’t chaw
his own arms,” shouted the Deacon, triumphantly. “I’m
fo’ defending the State and the white man’s rights; South
Car’linans shall rule South Car’lina,” and he reeled about the
room, swinging his limp arms, and shouting, “Hurrah for
South Car’lina! Hurrah for the old Pal-met-to State!”</p>

<p>“Come, come father,” said his son, “let me help you to
bed. You talk like a crazy man.” With the assistance of
Mrs. A., the Deacon was soon where his lips were safely
guarded by slumber.</p>

<p>“It is a pity you hadn’t let father join the Good Templers
with me, but may be he wouldn’t ha’ stuck to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
pledge,” said the boy, sadly, as he bade his mother good
night.</p>

<p>Near eleven o’clock the next morning, with nerves unstrung,
head sore, and stomach disordered, and altogether
in an irritable condition of mind and body, Deacon Atwood
sauntered out into one of his mother’s fields, where a
large mulatto man was mending a somewhat dilapidated
rail-fence. The hands of the farmer, were keeping time to
a succession of old plantation “spirituals” which rolled
from his capacious chest like the sound of a trumpet.</p>

<p>“We’ll march through the valley in that field.”</p>

<p>“Yo’ seem to be mighty happy this morning, Jesse,”
growled the Deacon.</p>

<p>“Well, Deacon, why shouldn’t I be happy? I’m well,
and my wife is well, and my children is well, and we’re all
about our business, and the children in school a learning,
and God Almighty is saving my soul, and raining his spirit
into my soul, and raining this beautiful sunshine down unto
the cawn (corn) and the cotton, to make ’em grow, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
why shouldn’t I sing? Why, brother Atwood, I feel like
I’d like to ring that beautiful bell so loud that all the folks
in the worl’’d hear it; a proclaiming that the Lord Jesus’ll
save every poor sinnah that’ll let him,” and the dark
face shone with the spirit-beams that glowed within.</p>

<p>The Deacon winced under the churchly title of brotherhood,
and what he thought a covert reproof, but yielding
to the power of a stronger and more rational nature than
his own, he did not remark upon it, though fondly imagining
that he felt himself vastly the superior.</p>

<p>“It is well enough to be happy if yo’ can, I reckon,” said
he, snappishly, “but I don’t feel so. I confess I’m thinking
more about politics now-a-days than about religion.”</p>

<p>“That’s no wonder then that yo’ a’n’t happy. It don’t
pay to get away from the Laud into politics&mdash;brings
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh, a plague on yo’r preaching! We must attend to
politics sometime: we can’t leave it to yo’ niggers all the
time. The Democratic Party has got to beat next fall, or
we’ll all be ruined together.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is right for you to think about politics,”
replied Jesse, “and to talk about politics, and to vote about
politics, but you know “<i>what-sa-ever</i> ye do&mdash;whether ye
eat, or drink, or <i>what-sa-ever</i> ye do, you must be a thinking
of the glory of the Laud.”</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t have no trouble in carrying this next
election if it wasn’t for these leading radicals,” said the
Deacon, in an angry mood, which had not been improved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
by Uncle Jesse’s reproof. “There is not more than one
in a thousand of the niggers that knows how to read and
write, but is an office-seeker; but I tell yo’, Jesse, every
one of ’em will be killed!”</p>

<p>A silence ensued, during which Deacon Atwood repeatedly
thrust his heel into the soft soil, and turning the toe
of his boot about, as though crushing some reptile, he
made a row of circular depressions along the side of a
cotton hill.</p>

<p>Pausing in his work, and pointing at the busy, great
foot, Mr. Roome (for that was Uncle Jesse’s name) remarked,
with a broad smile, “Deacon Atwood, them is
nice looking little places you’re making there, but allow
me to tell you that I reckon your wife won’t like the looks
o’ that black streak you’r making on the bottom of that
leg o’ them light-colored trousers o’ yourn.”</p>

<p>Vexed beyond control that he could not disturb the
equanimity of the colored man, the irate Deacon now
squared himself about, and, thrusting both his itching fists
deep into the pockets of the abused articles of his apparel,
he looked fiercely into the face of the negro, saying:</p>

<p>“Maybe you don’t believe me, but it is true, and all
settled; and I’ll bet you that Elly and Watta and Kanrasp
will be killed before another ’lection, and I can give you
the names of twenty more that will be killed, and among
them is ‘Old Bald-head’” (the Governor).</p>

<p>A shadow passed quickly across the dusky face, and a
set of fine teeth were firmly set together for a moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
But that soon passed, and the face wore its usual expression:
“What are you going to do with President
Grant and his soldiers?”</p>

<p>“Oh, all the No’th is on our side,” was the prompt
response. “And if it a’n’t, we don’t care for Grant nor
his soldiers. I carried a gun once, and I can again.”</p>

<p>The farmer had completed his work, and, folding his
arms, he now confronted his “Boss,” and spoke slowly and
impressively.</p>

<p>“Mind, now, what you’re doing, Deacon, for the United
States is <i>mighty strong</i>. You recollect once you had two
Presidents here, and it cost a long and bloody war, and the
country ha’n’t got over it yet.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but the No’th is on our side now, I tell yo’,
and we shall be able to carry our point.”</p>

<p>“May be so, I can’t tell,” said Jesse, dropping his hands
by his sides, “but I shall be very sorry to see another war
started here, and I didn’t live in the No’th from ’61 to ’67
to come back here and believe that the people there is
going to stand by you in killing us off to carry the election.
Maybe they’re tired of protecting us, and disgusted
with our blunders and our ignorance, but they won’t join
you nor nobody, nor uphold nobody in killing us off that
way.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll see we shall carry this next ’lection if we
have to carry it with the musket&mdash;if we have to wade
through blood to our saddle-girths,” said the Deacon.
“And more&mdash;this black Militia Company at Baconsville has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
got to stop drilling; it has got to be broken up. It is too
much for southern gentlemen to stand&mdash;flaunting their
flag and beating their drum right under our noses! It is a
general thing with us now from shor’ to shor’, and the law
can’t do nothing with so many of us if we do break it up,
and we’re going to.”</p>

<p>“Now, just be careful, Mr. Atwood, what you say, and
what you do. I a’n’t going to uphold our colored folks in
violating no law, and you know I ha’n’t, nor nobody else
neither. I believe in law, and I say let’s stick by the law;
and,” gathering up his implements of labor, “I suppose
you’ll excuse me, for I’ve got to go around to the other
side of this oat field, by the woods there, and mend that
other gap; that is, if you don’t care to walk around that
way.”</p>

<p>The Deacon did not care to walk that way, and so the
conversation ended for the time; though the subject was
frequently renewed during the subsequent summer months,
in the hope of inducing Roome, who was influential among
his people, to declare for the white man’s party, but in
vain.</p>

<p>A scion of a family that, in the early settlement of the
State, had procured a large tract of land at five cents per
acre, and had retained much of it through unprolific generations
by penuriousness that had been niggardly and cruel
in its exactions upon slave labor, Deacon Atwood was
coarse and gross in temperament, and had received little
culture of any kind. All his patrimony had vanished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
through the war and its results; for the parsimony of his
ancestors had formed no part of his inheritance, and he had
pledged all for the Confederate loan.</p>

<p>His aged mother&mdash;a violent rebel, and a widow before
the war&mdash;yet refused to pledge her land to raise funds for
what became the “Lost Cause,” and found means to retain
possession of one thousand acres of cotton land, for the management
of which her son was now acting as her agent. Mrs.
Deacon Atwood was what the reader has seen her, and not
an ill-selected specimen of the average planters’ wives,
who but seldom left the schoolless vicinities of their
homes; and as her family had fared no better than her husband’s
in the general financial overthrow, they were quite
naturally and rapidly drifting towards their affinity&mdash;the
social stratum called in ante-bellum times, “poor white
trash.”</p>

a chair? Well, what is the news from Bean Island and
Baconsville?”</p>

<p>“Bad, Mr. Elly, bad!” replied Uncle Jesse, as he seated
himself, and took from his hat a huge red cotton pocket-handkerchief,
with which he proceeded with great deliberation
to wipe his dusky face and bald head.</p>

<p>“I did not know it was so warm out,” said the courteous
host. “This office is such a cool place that I come up here
Sunday afternoons to be cool and quiet. It is a good place
to read.”</p>

<p>“I reckon it is not so warm to most folks. I’m hotter’n I
ought to be, I know; but I’m worreted,” said Uncle Jesse,
still wiping industriously with both hands at once, and
then thrusting the handkerchief into his hat which he had
been holding tightly between his knees, he placed it carefully
upon the floor beside him, and putting a hand upon
either knee, he leaned forward, looked earnestly into Mr.
Elly’s face, and with a significant expression, and in a low
tone asked, “Is you alone, Mr. Elly?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes; or, but&mdash;well, Mr. Watta is in the back office, but
I can close the door”&mdash;rising.</p>

<p>“No, no,” said Uncle Jesse, raising both hands deprecatingly.
“Ask him in; ask him in. Or, why can’t I go in
there?” glancing around at doors and windows.</p>

<p>“Certainly you can,” replied Elly. “Did you want to
see Mr. Watta?”</p>

<p>“I reckon so; yes. Well, now, this is what I call providential;
and I reckon I wa’n’t fur wrong in coming, if it is
Sunday. The folks in No’thern Ohio don’t do no business
on Sundays, and money paid Sunday a’n’t paid at all&mdash;can
be collected over again; but work is driving awfully now.
The freshet put the cawn back so for awhile; but it is
ketching up now. But I knowed I ought to come.”</p>

<p>Handshakings and preliminaries over, the trio were soon
seated around a large writing table&mdash;colored men all of
them. Both Elly and Watta were tall and slender&mdash;the
former quite black, and the latter very light&mdash;and both had
enjoyed the blessing of education at a Northern school
established for the benefit of freedmen, and almost sanctified
to the race by bearing the name of “Lincoln.”</p>

<p>Jesse Roome’s northern experiences had not been with
books, save at evening schools, of which he had eagerly
availed himself; but his naturally well-balanced mind and
keen powers of observation had not been idle; and sensible
ideas of common duties and relations of life in a highly-civilized
and enlightened community were his reward.</p>

<p>Elly was a thriving lawyer and ex-member of the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Legislature, where he had been “Speaker of the House,”
and, ever with an eye to business, he had already scented a
fee in his visitor’s troubled manner and reply.</p>

<p>“You must excuse my abruptness, but I leave on the
train for Columbia in half an hour,” said he, “and you and
Watta can talk after I am gone. Now, what can I do for
you?”</p>

<p>“First of all, I want some money for my services as
constable; and second I want to talk about the political
situation, and to tell you some things I have heard men say
that is interested. Well, how I got to know this thing&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What thing?” asked the lawyer. “Why, that Elly
and Watta and Kanrasp and some score of other radicals,
has got to be killed,” said Uncle Jesse, lowering his voice
to a husky whisper.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha?” roared Elly, throwing himself back in his
chair, till his head seemed in danger of getting wedged between
the chair-back and a bookcase behind him. “Why,
Roome, I thought you was a sensible man,” said he, when
he had recovered his breath. “The days of the Ku-Klux
Klan’s are over, and all done in this State. When we punished
two hundred and fifty of the fifteen hundred ‘very
respectable gentlemen,’ as they called each other, who were
arrested in 1871-’2, the thing was killed out here, you see.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t see,” said Roome.</p>

<p>“But do you suppose a man really means what he says
when he talks like that now-a-days?” and the two threatened
men laughed, and wriggled in great apparent merriment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and in true negro fashion, though really quaking with fear.</p>

<p>“I certainly do believe it, Mr. Elly, and Mr. Watta, and
I only hope the good Laud will show that I’ve been afeared
for you for nothing. The parties was in earnest, and intended
it, I’m shor’; and you know I’m not a old woman,
nor a baby to be scart for nothing.</p>

<p>“I’ve took the trouble to resk my life to tell yo’ to take
care of you’n, and now I’ve done my part. I didn’t tell
Watta right there to home, because I reckon as yo’ is a
lawyer, Mr. Elly, I’d best tell you first, and see what is
best to do for your protection. I taken trouble to do this.
But Watta is here now, and I’m done,” said the old man in
a grieved tone.</p>

<p>“We are much obliged for your kind intentions, though
you needn’t have been so much scared about us.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, let me tell you,” and the farmer proceeded
to narrate minutely the incidents and facts with which the
reader is already acquainted, and others of similar import.</p>

<p>“Give me names and I’ll put them through in the law,
for threats,” said Elly.</p>

<p>“I can’t do that,” said Jesse, folding his arms tightly.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I live in the woods, and my life wouldn’t be
worth anything; and I a’n’t going to tell yo’, though you’ll
believe me yet.”</p>

<p>“I believe <i>you</i> now, but I don’t believe you’re a white
man.”</p>

<p>“You will yet though, I ha’n’t nothing more to say now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
but just mind what I tell you. You is both men that is
marked to be killed, because you is leading radicals; so
the white folks says they is gwine to kill you and a score
more right round here close; I can’t help it, but I’ve done
my duty, and you must take car’ of yourselves. It wouldn’t
be no use to prosecute this man. It would only make the
whole of ’em mad, and worse than ever ’em open a hornet’s
nest; but I want to ax you this favor, just remember my
life now, as I’ve remembered your’n, and not tell that I
told you this.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we won’t tell, and we’re much obliged to you for
your good intentions but we don’t scare worth a cent,
after all.”</p>

<p>Uncle Jesse left the office, and the other men walked
down to the railroad station to meet the through train going
north.</p>

<p>“What do you think of the old man’s story?” asked
Watta.</p>

<p>“I don’t think much of it. He has maintained such an
equivocal attitude that it is hard to tell whose hands he is
playing into. He has been on one side and then on the
other&mdash;with the colored people and then with the whites,
till there is no telling where he is now.”</p>

<p>“Elly, you are unfair. That man is just as true as steel;
he is solid gold all through. He is with the side that is
right, that is all, only he has more courage to speak out
than some of us have. I reckon the fact is that the right
hasn’t <i>always</i> been the colored side. I’m afraid it hasn’t,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
though we’ve had so much the worst chance since we’ve
had a chance at all, and such an outrageous list of grievances
to remember, and to bear, that it isn’t an ordinary man
that can look at things fairly here.”</p>

<p>Now, I have a mind to think there is something serious
in this matter, and that there will be more and more as
election approaches. The white men at Baconsville are
<i>awful mad</i>, because our Militia Company has been reorganized
lately, and has been preparing for the centennial
Fourth of July. One would think they expected to be
massacred in their beds; and so they go to work and do
things that might make every nigger mad at them. Sensible,
isn’t it?</p>

<p>“They are just raving, the white men are, some of them,
and they do talk dreadfully. Old man Bob Baker there,
gets into a passion whenever he sees us drilling on Market
street. He hates to see a nigger he has hunted in the
swamps before the war, and his dogs couldn’t catch, or
could, practicing the use of arms with a State gun in his
hands, and the Union flag over his head. He is like a mad
bull, and “the stars and stripes” is the red rag that sets
him a roaring and tearing up the ground.”</p>

<p>Here Watta, the speaker, slapped his companion’s shoulder,
and both broke into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“He has got an idea,” he resumed, “that all the roads
within five miles of his plantation belong to <i>him</i>, I
reckon, by the way he swears whenever he meets or passes
the Company. I tell the boys to give the flag an extra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
spread whenever he is in sight, and we have it out.”</p>

<p>“It is the flag of the Union that you carry, and you are
the National Guards of South Carolina, too,” replied Elly.</p>

<p>“Well, it <i>is cutting</i> to the old rebel and slave-hunter!” he
continued. His occupation is gone, gone forever; and I
don’t suppose he or his trained blood-hounds take kindly
to such cheap game as possoms. There is a mighty sight
of brag and bluster about these southern whites, though
they’ll dodge quick enough at sight of a United States
musket with a Yankee behind it. They hav’n’t forgotten
their whipping yet.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but they’ll dodge back again just as quick, when
the musket and Yankee soldier are withdrawn, and they
are fast forgetting the past; and this centennial year and
celebration are unwelcome reminders of it which they
would like to resent.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I reckon so. You see the mention of the
rebellion as one of the hard strains which the Union has
survived cannot well be avoided, and so the “red rag,” as
you call it, is in their faces pretty often if they take a
newspaper, or steal the reading of one. There are only five
white men, ‘gentlemen,’ who call upon me regularly to
get the reading of my papers, free of course, and call me a
‘nigger.’ They don’t take a single paper themselves, nor
buy one, nor say ‘thank ye’ for mine; nor always think to
ask if I have read it myself.</p>

<p>“Ah, there she comes! right on time;” and Elly closed
and pocketed his gold watch, while the train approached
the platform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’ll see, Jesse? Please get that name out of him,
and I’ll put the rascal through for threats; though I’m not
afraid of him. Good day,” and with the grace of a courtier
he waved adieu to his friend, as the train moved away.</p>

<p>He was soon comfortably seated, and gazing out at the window.
He was very well dressed, in strong contrast with a
large majority of his race in the southern States. His tall
shining hat lay beside him upon the crimson plush cushion of
the seat, leaving his crisp and glossy frizzed hair the only
covering of his shapely head.</p>

<p>Among the occupants of the car were many “northerners”
returning from winter residences in Florida.</p>

<p>“We talk of the receding foreheads and projecting jaws
of the African,” said a lady sitting opposite, in a subdued
tone to her masculine companion, “but just imagine those
two men with hair and complexions exchanged,” indicating
Elly and a man in the seat immediately in front of him,
who was in a double sense, a fair specimen of southern
“poor white trash.”</p>

<p class="pp6qs p1">“‘Now, deil-ma-care about their jaws,<br />
The senseless, gawky million,’</p>

<p class="pn1">“As Burns says,</p>

<p class="pp6s p1">‘I’ll cock my nose aboon them a’,’</p>

<p class="pn1">“For I’m bound for dear New England, away from
this land of rags and dirt, slatterly ways, lazy habits,
flowing whiskey and tobacco, narrow brows and
wide mouths, and people of all imaginable shades,
from ebony to cream-color or white,” replied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
gentleman. “If you like to continue studying and comparing
these faces, do so; but don’t suggest it to me, for
I long to be where the very air is not darkened with&mdash;‘nigger,
<i>nigger</i>’ and my ears shall rest from the sound of
their uncouth voices.”</p>

<p>“Their voices are expressive. You should call out the
smooth tones.”</p>

<p>“But I can’t always. I’m sure I can’t forget the night
of our arrival at Jacksonville,” he continued, “Thirty,
weren’t there <i>fifty</i> black men standing near that train, all
<i>barking</i> their loudest for passengers? Yes, you may reprove
me, I know these don’t sound like the words of an
abolitionist. But I am one, I insist; but if upon oath
describing that sound that greeted our arrival in that city,
I must say the voices of ‘thirty yelping curs;’ and to
pass through among them, with their grabbing for one’s
baggage, and those frightful sounds in one’s ears, and the
knowledge of the unsettled state of the country&mdash;the antagonism
between the races&mdash;I’d as lief&mdash;well, I don’t
know what I wouldn’t choose!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but if, when that big-mouthed, two-fisted fellow
grabbed your satchel, you, instead of striking him with
your cane and umbrella, had looked kindly into his great-rolling
eyes, and mildly said you preferred to walk and
carry it yourself, I think he would have dropped it as
quickly, and more quietly, and been more likely to remember
you kindly. I remember quite similar scenes in the
North, with Irish hackmen. But we have outgrown them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
and so will the South, and the negroes out-grow these
scenes; and for me, the more I see these colored faces, the
more that is intelligent and agreeable I see in them.”</p>

<p>Elly’s face had been singularly bright and cheerful before
over-hearing this colloquy; but then a change came, and
presently he leaned out of the window, gazing at a large
dilapidated mansion (it could not worthily be called a ruin,)
which stood some rods from the railroad.</p>

<p>Many a day he had played about the door of a poor little
cabin in its rear, or ran at the bidding of his young mistress
as she walked in a small grove the train was just then entering;
or had held the bridles for the gentlemen mounting at
the door of “the great house,” watching well their movements,
least, as is the habit of some men to cut their dogs
with their whips and laugh at their yelps and leaps, they
should thus enjoy an exhibition of his agility.</p>

<p>Under that great tree, in the edge of yonder cornfield,
his mother writhed under the lash, for complaining that
her task was too heavy; and obliged to witness the rising
of the great welts upon her naked back, his father had
snatched the instrument of torture from the hand that
wielded it, and on an attempt being made to dispossess him
of it, had dealt the overseer a smart blow across the back
of his hand.</p>

<p>Then had followed a gathering of “the hands” from
that and neighboring plantations, to witness the “maintenance
of discipline,” and Elly’s father&mdash;a valuable specimen
of plantation stock&mdash;was made, under the cat o’ nine
tails, a physical wreck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Beside that old decaying cotton-house, now scarcely visible,
his oldest sister was once hung up by her hands and
severely whipped, because she preferred field labor by the
side of the father of her child, who was called her husband,
to what was called an easier life&mdash;in “the big house after
Missus got sick, and was agwoine’ to die.”</p>

<p>Next, the train rattled over a long stretch of spiling
though a cane-brake, where were familiar trees, under
which Elly had paused for breath, and standing upon their
knotted roots, listened to the baying of pursuing blood-hounds;
and so vivid was his recollection of this, his first
attempt to escape from slavery, that the sick, cringing,
trembling feeling returned as he observed the bent canes
leaning away from the half-submerged ties of the railroad
track; an involuntarily moving of his feet upon the car floor,
as if again seeking a footing upon their bent stalks, a semiconsciousness
of present circumstances was restored, through
which his mind leaped over the terrible capture and chastisement,
and he seemed again to hear the sounds of the
“Yankee Camp,” and felt the joy of his happy entrance
there, a “Contraband of war,” but a chattel slave no longer.</p>

<p>Then came a realization of the inestimable service the
“Yankee Governess” had rendered him when she stealthily
taught him to read, and spurred his young master’s lazy
efforts, by contrasting his acquirements with those of the
listening slave boy.</p>

<p>Through that poor beginning, made in weakness and
danger on the part of both pupil and teacher, when it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
a crime, punishable by imprisonment in the State’s Prison,
he had made his way to positions of honor and emolument.</p>

<p>What meekness, humility and honesty must not a man
of such experiences possess, if, conning them over, pride
did not lift up his heart, resentment make his arm restless,
and a sense of robbery long-endured, make his present
powerful position seem a providential opportunity for
retaliation and self-reimbursement! From an abyss of enforced
degradation and ignorance and despair he had
emerged into the light and life of personal and political
liberty, equality, respectability and honor; and the young
master whose opportunities he once so earnestly coveted,
and before whose absolute will he was forced to bow, now
sued for favors at his hands, and found “none so poor to
do him reverence.” Was ever the nobility of human
nature put to stronger tests than in these two peoples?</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Elly,” said a broad-browed, florid-faced,
red-haired man in the aisle beside him.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Marmor, good evening;” was the hearty
response. “Take a seat?” removing his hat to make
room.</p>

<p>“I will gladly take the seat, if you will just step out
and let me turn over the back of this one in front, so that
we can have the use of the two sofas, for my feet are at
their old tricks and troubling me a good deal. They are
easier when I lay them up. One might as well personate
‘Young America’ in this Centennial year when it makes
him more comfortable.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mind you don’t get them too high now,” said Elly, as
they seated themselves after the change, and he spread a
newspaper upon the cushion before them, to protect it
from Marmor’s boot-blacking. “You might share the misfortune
of Ike Partington; and if all your brains <i>should</i>
run down into your head, what would become of “The
Times?” and Elly laughed and wriggled, in strange and
silly contrast with his usually dignified manner.</p>

<p>“I don’t furnish brains for “The Times”, said Marmor,
“I only publish it. But what is the campaign going to
be, do you think?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course we shall win.”</p>

<p>Marmor kept his eyes fixed upon his middle finger nail,
which he was carefully cutting, and did not reply.</p>

<p>Elly scrutinized his face awhile, and then asked, “Don’t
you think so?”</p>

<p>“I am not so positive as I wish I was.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think the colored voters of the State are
going back on the party that gave them freedom, and the
only one that will preserve it for them? They’ll all vote
the Republican ticket, of course.”</p>

<p>“Yes, unless they are intimidated.”</p>

<p>“Now, Marmor, I’ve seen a hint&mdash;or what I take for
one&mdash;in your paper; but I hope you don’t really think
there will be trouble.”</p>

<p>“I <i>am</i> afraid there will be trouble. Hanson Baker told
me the other day that there are fifteen hundred men ready
and waiting to come there and break up the Militia Company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
in Baconsville, and that they are going to do it; and
it is a frequent boast among the men&mdash;the white Southerners,
I mean&mdash;that they will carry the election if they
have to do it at the point of the bayonet. They can’t do
it honestly, that’s shor’; but I’m afraid there will be
trouble.”</p>

<p>A pause ensued, after which Marmor resumed. “I’m
almost tired of this State, and if my business could be
squared up I’d get away; but I shan’t be driven out. I
wish the colored people had the spunk to emigrate to some
of the idle western land. It is a heap better and richer
than this here, by all accounts; and though it might be
some colder, it would make them stronger and smarter, and
they’d be heaps better off than they are here.”</p>

<p>“There <i>are</i> a great many <i>talking about it</i>, don’t you
know&mdash;going by colonies? It would be a deal better than
going to Africa. I shall go myself if the old Confederates
ever get into power here again.”</p>

<p>“See you stick to that, Elly; and, as for me, I reckon I
shall have to go by that time, or before. I was born in
South Carolina, and shed my blood in defense of her (as I
thought then), at Fort Sumter, got wounded there, and I
was as good as any of them till I consented to accept a
clerical office under a Republican administration; and then
the old Confederates persecuted me and my wife, till I
found out how it felt to others, and I have seen under what
tyranny a man lives here. He dares not think for
himself at all. I served under Hampton in the war, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
I got my eyes open. Like most of the private soldiers,
and plenty of commissioned officers, I was made to believe
a lie, or I never would have raised a hand against the National
Government in the world. I used to say just this
way: If the No’th would only let us manage our State matters
ourselves, and would let our slaves alone (you know I
owned a few slaves), I didn’t care if the Territories and
new States were free. But Lincoln, and Garrison, and
Greeley shouldn’t come down here, and take our nigger
property away from us; they shouldn’t be emancipated
by the United States Government&mdash;the slaves shouldn’t.
Enough others said the same, and dozens of our speakers
said it on the stump and platform, and plenty of the great
leaders were right there&mdash;consenting by their silence, if not
saying the same things, when <i>they</i> knew well enough that
these were just the principles of the Republican party&mdash;the
‘Unionists’ who elected Lincoln. What did <i>we</i> care
for their ‘sympathy for the slaves,’ or their <i>wishes</i> for the
‘constitutional right’ to liberate them, so long as they
admitted they hadn’t got it, and we knew they couldn’t
get it short of a two-thirds indorsement by the States
through a direct vote of the people? There was slave
property enough in sixteen of the thirty-four States to
make us pretty sure on that score, in addition to the interests
of cotton manufacturers and sugar dealers in the No’th
who wanted our products and no interruption of business.
Then we had the Fugitive Slave Law for the return of our
runaways.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you know the Republican idea was that the new
States coming in, being all free, they could at last secure
the constitutional two-thirds.”</p>

<p>“Yes, at <i>last</i>” said Marmor, derisively, “<i>at the last
great day</i>, while slave-owners had each a vote for three out
of every five of his slaves without asking their assent. But
our hot-headed course hastened emancipation about a hundred
years; and now that it is over I’m glad of it, though
it did cost an ocean of blood and treasure. Slavery cursed
the whites as well as the blacks, and ought to. When I
think of all I saw in that war&mdash;I got this difficulty in my
feet there (moving them with a grimace), and of the horrible
sufferings it brought on our people, and how those
leading villains knew all the time that they were deceiving
us, I can’t think what wouldn’t be too good for them!
And when that war was over, and the No’th had us in her
hand as helpless as a trapped mouse, she not only spared
their lives, but gave everything back to them which they
had forfeited; and now you hear them go on about the
National Government and the northern people, especially
any that come and settle among us and try to develop the
resources of the State, in a way that is simply outrageous!
You would think the South was the magnanimous <i>patron</i> of
the stiff-necked and rebellious No’th. I verily believe the
South would have liked the No’th better if it had put its
foot upon her after she fell. Conquer your rebellious child
or yield to his dictation without demur.</p>

<p>“There are some who know no such thing as equality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Somebody must be the ‘Boss’, in their practice.”</p>

<p>“But republican principles would not allow the government
to hold these States as provinces,” remarked lawyer
Elly.</p>

<p>“They should have been held as territories,” said Marmor,
“consistently or not. My blood is German (my father
emigrated from Germany to Charleston when a small boy),
but it has got the South Car’lina heat in it. I’m for <i>efficiency</i>.”</p>

<p>“Nineteen-twentieths of what they call carpet-baggers,
and make folks believe are just adventurers, are northern
men, capitalists generally, who in emigrating did not leave
their manhood behind. It matters not how heavy taxes
they may pay, nor how long they remain in the State; if
they vote the Republican ticket and maintain the principles
and practice of equal justice for all men in the State,
they are ‘carpet-baggers;’ and if they vote Democratic,
according to the will of the confederate whites, though
they vote ‘early and often,’ and at points far removed
from each other, they escape the opprobious epithet.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">On</span> an insignificant little village built on a narrow flat
beside the Savannah river, the sun had been pouring his
red hot rays all day, with even greater intensity than was
usual at that season of the year.</p>

<p>The inhabitants, however, paid little heed to the extreme
heat, and only when the sun sank to the western horizon
did they leave their fields and workshops and wend their
ways homewards.</p>

<p>Two railroad bridges, and another for the public highway,
connected this little village with the city of A&mdash;&mdash;,
on the opposite side of the river, and in the neighboring
State of Georgia.</p>

<p>A long low trestle carried one of those railroad tracks
two or three squares or streets back from the stream towards
the hills a half-mile away.</p>

<p>Not far from this trestle, on a broad street which ran
parallel with and along the brink of the stream, stood a
strong, two-story brick building. Its uses had been
various; but at the time of which we write it did
service as an armory or drill room for Co. A of
the Eighteenth Regiment of National Guards of South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Carolina; and also as a dwelling for the Captain of
the Company, who, having just returned from his day’s
work in the city, now sat with his chair tilted back against
the post of the open door, tossing his infant and conversing
with his wife, who was preparing their evening meal.</p>

<p>It might be mentioned that the parties in this little
domestic scene were of African descent.</p>

<p>“Howdy? Cap’n Doc, Howdy?” shouted a negro teamster,
driving up to the door with a great dash and rattling
of wheels.</p>

<p>“Hello! That yo’, Dan?” replied the Captain, letting
the front legs of his chair down upon the floor with a bump
that came near unseating him. “Come in, won’t ye?”</p>

<p>“I’m obliged to yo’, but I couldn’t nohow. I just wants,
to know what sort of a combustification is we gwoine to
hev to-morrow; and when does de militia come out?”</p>

<p>The speaker was evidently “the worse for the drink,”
which must account for his forgetfulmess of what he had
been well informed of, and he wriggled and giggled as if
greatly tickled.</p>

<p>“The militia,” said Captain Doc, “has got to faum
(form) and march down to the grounds, when the doings
begin, and stand guard; and after the speeches and all is
ovah, we shall go through the usual everlutions, accompanied
with music and the flag. I’m sorry we didn’t get that
shooting-match I tried to have, so we could ha’ got some unifaum;
but I shall inspeck yo’s guns and accouterments
mighty close, and put yo’ through mighty sharp on the
drill.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>“But a nigger that don’t car’ ’nough ’bout the Centennial
fo’th o’ July to get to know all ’bout the doings fo’ the
third o’ July, don’t ’zerve to be baun free and ekil.”</p>

<p>“Wal, I wa’n’t baun free an’ ekil, an’ I don’t ’speck to
be baun free an’ ekil, nuther, but ’fo’ I done gone ovah to
’Gusta wid dis ere load o’ truck, I knowed all ’bout it. But
I met dat are <i>magnifishent</i> young gem’man, Tom Bakah,
and, oh, laws!” (spreading his horny palms, with fingers
extended and rolling his head and eyes from side to side),
“‘mose put my eyes out o’ my head! All upsot my idees!
His nose turned up, ’pears like six feet high; no, six inches
high; and he drove he horse so scrumbunctious like, ’mose
upset my little ambulancer,” and Dan turned to his two
little rats of donkeys in harness of knotted raw-hides,
which resembled old and assorted clothes lines.</p>

<p>The little creatures stood meekly before an indescribable
vehicle, a ridiculous cross between a rude hay-rick and a
huge crockery-crate on wheels. It was all out of proportion
to the little team, whose backs were scarcely as high
as the waist-bands of stumpy Dan.</p>

<p>“Tough little fellahs, dese is,” said the teamster, patting
them affectionately, “but mighty feared o’ Mars’ Tom, a’n’t
yo’,&mdash;Eigh, Jack?”</p>

<p>“See dat nigh critter cock his eye now, and wag dat off
ear,” continued Dan, winking at Captain Doc, and giggling
and wriggling as before.</p>

<p>“Don’t like Mars’ Tom, do yo’, Jack?” again addressing
the intelligent donkey, which not only wagged his off ear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
but shook his head in a most decided manner, to the great
amusement of his owner.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dan, you musn’t mind the antics of that boy Tom,”
said a voice behind him; whereupon Dan wriggled and
jumped, and whirled about, and bowed himself double, and
made grimaces, and giggled and wriggled, and danced a
jig; and finally, with another low bow and long scrape of
his right foot, he shook hands with the speaker, who was
no other than our friend Marmor. “Tom is only just home
from school, you know, and of course the man who knew
more before he was born than could ever be cudgeled into
that knowledge-box of hissen, is <i>nothing</i> to him! Let him
alone, and let him swell though, just as big as he can, he’ll
bust the quicker, and we’ll find out the quicker how big he
really is when the vacuum is gone, and what is left is
packed down solid.”</p>

<p>“‘Pears like dis yere young Tom cat tinks he smell a
mice, or a niggah he’s huntin,” said Dan, “an’ he’s gwoine
fo’ to <i>chaw ’im up</i> mighty quick!” (suiting his gesture to
his words by a long sniff, and a quick motion of his jaws.)</p>

<p>Dan’s buffoonery was irresistible, and the half dozen persons
who had gathered at the captain’s door manifested their
appreciation by hilarious applause.</p>

<p>“‘Pears like I couldn’t leave such ’stinguished comp’ny,
nohow,” he continued, “but dey is a panoramia fo’ my vishum
which am decomrated by hoe cakes an’ hominy, an’ lasses
an’ bacon, an’ sich tings;” and with his hands upon his
empty stomach, Dan bowed very low and obsequiously,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and mounting his “ambulancer,” gathered up the ragged
ends of his raw-hide ribbons, touched Jack with his long
green stick, and rattled away, while Captain Doc shouted
after him, “Two o’clock, and no tipsy men on parade.”</p>

<p>The queer little turnout, which would have been a spectacle
in any part of the northern states, though common
enough in the southern, crept slowly up the steep hill in
the rear of the village, where buildings of curious and
indescribable styles were scattered without order or taste,
and few indications of thrift. Stopping on the outskirts
of the town, and before a small cabin built of one thickness
of rough boards, the vertical cracks between which
would nearly receive the fingers of an adult, and the windows
of which, without sash or glazing, were closed only
by clumsy wooden shutters&mdash;the usual style of cabin inhabited
by the southern negro&mdash;Dan leaped from his
vehicle, and entering, sniffed and looked about searchingly,
till a tall, angular mulatto woman entered from the back
door with an armful of wood.</p>

<p>“Any suppah yet, Mira?”</p>

<p>“No, sah. Yo’ suppah ha’n’t ready yit, but I’s cookin’ it.
I’s mighty tired. I’s done done all dat whole big cotton
field.”</p>

<p>“Good, chile! good, chile!” said the husband, approaching
and attempting to kiss her as she stooped to replenish
the open fire.</p>

<p>No sooner had his breath touched her face than she
turned, with a stick of wood in one hand, and confronted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
him, while the smoke and flame leaped out in alarming
proximity to her dress.</p>

<p>“See here now, yo’ Dan; yo’ been drinkin’ gin,” fixing
her dark eyes reprovingly upon his silly face. “Dat’s de
way yo’ been spendin’ yo’ money.”</p>

<p>“Mira Pipsie, yo’s de smartest woman in de whole worl’.
Yo’s got ’em zackly, I reckon” (wriggling and curveting
about the room and back to her side again). “I nebber
boughtened me no finery o’ no kind; no new bonnet, nor
nuffin. Yo’ buys what yo’ wants, an’ so does I.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but yo’ comes home an’ wants suppah, an’ it’s de
cotton o’ my raisin’ as buys yo’ suppah.”</p>

<p>“Yah! yah! yah! I’s a lucky dog, shor!” and he executed
a jig followed by a double shuffle, knocking his heels
upon the bare floor with what vigor he could command,
and at the same time improvising as follows:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">
“I’s de smartest little wife<br />
Ebber seen in all yo’ life;<br />
She marks her cotton-bag<br />
Wid a little calico rag,<br />
An’ gits de biggis’ price,<br />
An’ as slick as any mice<br />
She smiles, an’ bows, an’ flies aroun’,<br />
An’ totes her cotton off to town.<br />
Home she comes, an’ O my!<br />
See de new bonnet! <i>Oh, my eye!</i><br />
Away to church she sing an’ pray,<br />
Hallelujah! look dis way!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>Dina Duncan’s in de shade,<br />
Mira beats all on dress parade.<br />
But jes’ see Dina’s <i>bran new shawl</i>!<br />
Can’t heah no mo’ preachin’ af’er all.<br />
Elder, I’m gone nex’ Sunday sho’,<br />
Can’t wear dis here ole shawl o’ mine no mo’!”</p>

<p class="p1">Here the song abruptly terminated, for the “smartest little
wife,” who was some inches taller than her husband, and
by no means slender, took her liege lord by the damp, unstarched
collar of his soiled blue shirt, and marching him
to the door, seated him upon the step, saying in a low, decided,
and well recognized tone, “Now yo’ jes’ set dar, yo’
drunk niggah, yo’, an’ don’t yo’ open dat big red mouf o’
yo’n no mo’ till I git some hominy to fill it up. I don’t
want no niggah’s heels scratchin’ roun’ on my flo’. Ef
yo’d buy bettah finery ’n dem ole trowsahs, an’ go to
church, an’ let whiskey ’lone, yo’ cotton’d be some good.
Ef I didn’t mark my cotton o’ my raisin’, an’ toat de
money myself, I’d jes like t’ know whar yo’d git yo’ tea,
an’ coffee, an’ flou’h, an’ all dem tings?”</p>

<p>With an admonitory shake of her finger, she entered the
house, and resumed her culinary operations; but soon
reappeared, bearing a gun and accoutrements, and sundry
materials for polishing them; having first dexterously
examined it, and found it without charge.</p>

<p>“Heah now, yo’ Pipsie; yo’ got sense ’nough t’ clean dis
’ere gun?” she asked. “Reckon you’ll be mighty proud
o’ dis ’ere ‘finery,’ marchin’ up an’ down long o’ de res’,
an’ de folks all lookin’ on.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“He, he! Didn’t I say ‘smartest little wife’? Reckon
I kin do dat are. Reckon I’ll p’rade on de fo’th, an’ yo’ll
wait till Sunday.”</p>

<p>Two of his neighbors presently joined Mr. Pipsie, with
whom he was soon discussing the anticipated celebration,
which was quite a novelty in the locality. Suddenly a loud
sound of wheels was heard.</p>

<p>“Hello!” cried Dan, springing from his seat. “Heah
comes my friend Bakah! Hello, Babe! Bett’ take car, dat
team, else yo’ git toated clean off, an gone to smash ’fo’
yo’ muddah knows nuffin ’bout it. Reckon yo’ didn’t ax
her mout yo’ gwout alone?”</p>

<p>The sound of the jolting wagon rendered this speech inaudible
to the youthful driver, who was passing without a
“Howdy!” (an offense in that locality) but the loud, derisive
“guffaw” of the three colored men, which followed
Dan’s sally, did not fail to reach him, and he paused suddenly,
just past the door.</p>

<p>He was tall and large, but unusually boyish for a youth
of twenty years. In an angry tone he shouted:</p>

<p>“Dan Pipsie, come out here! I want to see yer.”</p>

<p>That individual made his way, quite deliberately, to the
side of the vehicle, and with a strange mixture of timidity
and bravado in his manner.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by cursing me in that way? I
ha’n’t done nothing to you,” said the boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, laws! I’s jest in fun, an’ I’s shor’ yo’ didn’t heah
yo’r name mixin’ up in it. A man’s a right to talk or cuss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
on his own do’,” (door) “an’ nothin’ to no man no’ his boy
gwoine ’long de road.”</p>

<p>The youngster’s eyes flashed, and his face was pale with
rage. What! <i>he</i> to be called a <i>boy</i> by a “nigger?” He
looked down upon the diminutive black figure beside him,
in whose hands was one of Remington’s best rifles, and that
alone restrained him from laying the long lash of his
driving-whip close about the “black biped,” as he mentally
called him. He did venture to retort with some asperity.</p>

<p>The altercation was brief, but heated, and soon the whip
was cracked decidedly closer to Pipsie’s left ear than was
comfortable to its owner.</p>

<p>“Yo’ jes be little mo’ ca’ful, yo’ young man!” said Pipsie,
rubbing the ear briskly. “Yo’ not got no runaway
niggah slave heah now. I’se a free man, an’ got as much
rights as yo’, an’ mo’n dat, too, I’se got a United States
gun heah, an’ I knows how to shoot, too. Yo’ needn’t
’sult no National Guards fo’ nuffin’. Ef yo’ ha’n’t got no
mo’ yo’ want say t’ me, yo’ bes’ jes’ git ’long ’bout yo’
business, or yo’ may git hurt!” and he made a feint to raise
the empty gun to his eye, when young Tom Baker rode
away in great haste.</p>

<p>Baconsville had never witnessed such a “celebration” as
it enjoyed the next day, which came bright and beautiful.</p>

<p>Though usually tardy in morning rising&mdash;possibly from
dread of the malaria, which the sun dissipates by nine
o’clock, on this memorable day, the inhabitants of the village
were astir at an early hour, for, through the heavy fog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
which crept up from the river, and shrouded the whole valley,
the red-haired and fair-skinned Marmor, and the largest,
strongest, and blackest citizen, with a few followers, were
dimly visible, dragging a blacksmith’s anvil along the
principal streets.</p>

<p>They paused frequently in front of the residences and
shops of the chief citizens to salute them by an explosion
of gunpowder upon the anvil&mdash;the nearest approach to a cannonade
possible in the impecuneous little city. But not
earlier than four o’clock in the afternoon was the excitement
at its height. At that time the brass band was playing
national airs under a great oak tree on a vacant plot
of ground on which a platform had been erected; and a
few seats placed in front of it for the accommodation of
the gentler sex were rapidly filling; for, at a safe distance,
thirteen explosions upon the anvil, in commemoration of
the thirteen original colonies, were being followed by
thirty-seven, in honor of the then existing States of the
Union.</p>

<p>These were the recognized signals for the commencement
of the most important exercises of the day; and the militia
having formed at the armory, marched to the rostrum,
bearing the “Stars and Stripes,” and were disposed on
either side of the speaker’s stand, while other free and
patriotic citizens stood in compact groups near and about
the well-filled seats.</p>

<p>All being ready, a chairman elected, the glass of water
and bouquet of flowers placed before the speaker, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
band having duly discoursed, a short, smooth-voiced negro&mdash;an
accredited preacher of the Methodist persuasion, and
member of the State Legislature from that district&mdash;was
introduced. He made a long, peculiarly energetic, interesting
and instructive address, rich in metaphor and quaint
expressions, glowing with native eloquence, and abounding
in graphic description, wholesome counsel, and eulogy of the
“United States.”</p>

<p>Not an allusion was made to the past relations of the
races in the South, unless an exhortation to gratitude towards
the United States be so construed, in view of the
fact that the very few whites present acknowledged no
such debt.</p>

<p>After the address, music followed, and then Marmor was
formally introduced to his neighbors, and read in clear, loud
tones the inevitable “Preamble and Declaration of Independence,”
to the manifest disgust of a small group of
men who stood in the rear of the crowd.</p>

<p>A tall, muscular man, with iron-gray hair and bushy
beard, turned upon his heel with an oath, saying: “Marmor,
the contemptible radical, takes too much pleasure in
reading that preamble to me, and I’m a fool to hear it any
way. <i>All men created equal!</i> It is a self-evident lie!” and
he strode away, followed by the boyish young man, Tom,
to whom the reader has already been introduced.</p>

<p>“Father,” said he, “that red-headed fool acts like a
Yankee. You wouldn’t suppose he fought for the Lost
Cause.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is the cursed German blood in him!” replied “the old
man Baker,” as his neighbors called him. “He hasn’t been
in the State long enough to get the Republican taint out of
it. His father wasn’t born here.”</p>

<p>“It is a pity that a Yankee bullet hadn’t hit <i>him</i>, instead
of brother Will.” He’s a scalawag and a carpet-bagger,
both in one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’d like to rid the State of his presence, and the
niggers of one leader. If it wasn’t for the leaders, we
could manage the ignorant ones.”</p>

<p>The exercises at “the stand” closed at five o’clock, and
the Militia soon formed, thirty or forty strong, and marched
off up Market street; which being over one hundred and
fifty feet in width, afforded ample space for the evolutions
which the men performed with commendable precision for
nearly an hour.</p>

<p>At length they stood resting at the upper end of the
street.</p>

<p>“Have you noticed the clouds, Captain?” asked the tall
second-lieutenant, approaching his superior with raised cap,
“That’s so, Watta,” replied Captain Doc, glancing at the
clouds, “We’ll march down to the armory and dismiss. Attention,
Company.”</p>

<p>The necessary orders being given, they proceeded by
fours, interval march, open order, with guns across their
shoulders, and arms over their guns; thus occupying little
over one third of the width of the street.</p>

<p>Soon after they had thus started, a single buggy occupied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
by two young men, turned from Main street into Market
street, entering it two or three streets in front of them
and approached the advancing Militia-men at a slow trot.
The horse was old and steady, and neither the glittering
guns, nor flag, nor fife and drum disturbed his equanimity;
and, urged by his driver, he did not pause nor turn aside
till in the very face of the soldiers, who had already
halted.</p>

<p>The road was broad and level, but the travel had been
confined mostly to one track, and the remainder of the surface
was overgrown with grass and May weeds.</p>

<p>Just at the place of their meeting, a well occupied a few
feet in the centre of the street; and a shallow ditch crossed
the half of the street at the right of the vehicle. Yet
fully fifteen feet of the level highway was unoccupied at
the right of the Militia, and the driver could easily have
passed around the Company, had he chosen to do so, instead
of urging his horse directly upon the advancing column.</p>

<p>The discourtesy of this act was aggravated by the fact
that the young men had, during a half-hour previously,
been driving leisurely from one bar-room to another, or sitting
in their carriage and watching the movements of the Company
in common with a large number of other citizens,
both white and colored, during which time frequent opportunities
had occurred in which they might have driven up
the then totally unoccupied street.</p>

<p>These young men were Tom Baker and his sister’s husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Harry Gaston, who, like his father-in-law, had often
expressed his aversion to “the Nigger Militia Company.”</p>

<p>Captain Doc left his position, and approaching them said:</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaston, I do not know for what reason you treat
me in this manner.”</p>

<p>“What manner?”</p>

<p>“Aiming to drive through my company when you have
room enough on the outside to drive in the road.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is the rut I always travel in,” was the contemptuous
reply, made with an oath.</p>

<p>“That may be true,” replied the Captain, “but if ever you
had a company out here, I should not have treated you in
this kind of a manner. I should have gone around, and
showed some respect to you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” retorted Gaston, “this is the rut I always travel
in, and I don’t intend to get out of it for no niggers!”</p>

<p>“You don’t intend to break up our drill do you?” asked
Lieutenant Watta; his yellow face growing visibly pale.</p>

<p>“All I want is to pass through and go home.”</p>

<p>“But you want to drive through our ranks.”</p>

<p>“No! &mdash;&mdash;. He can’t go through here,” said another
voice.</p>

<p>“We will stay here all night before we will give way to
them,” said Watta, the conversation with lawyer Elly and
Uncle Jesse recurring to his memory.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Gaston with an oath, “you won’t
always be insulting me. You had better stop now, for
you’ll find you’ve got to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“Egh, Watta, don’t yos’ mind what Mann Harris said&mdash;tole
that Hanson Baker, Tom’s brother, said a month ago
that there’s gwoine to be the &mdash;&mdash; to pay in Baconsville
pretty soon? Reckon the white folks is begun that p’ogramme
he tole ’bout,” said another militia man. “He said
fifteen hundred of ’em was ready to break us up, an’ of co’se
Gasten’s one of ’em.”</p>

<p>A volley of oaths and abusive epithets was rolling from
Tommy Baker’s lips; which was indeed their most familiar
utterance when addressing persons of color; and some members
of the company began to return the charge in kind.</p>

<p>“Attention, company!” shouted Capt. Doc. “It is
going to rain, and we had best house our guns. We won’t
hold any contention with these men. Now, yo’ hush up!
I’ll settle this matter. Open order, and let them go
through.”</p>

<p>The command was obeyed, but not without murmurs
of discontent, which, however, were soon quieted, as a
slight shower descended, and they hastened off to the
armory.</p>

<p>Marmor, with his two little children, had been standing
a few rods away, watching and praising the exercise.</p>

<p>When the altercation occurred, being a Warden of the
town, he sent John Carr, the Town Marshal, or Chief of
Police, to ascertain its cause; but it was passed before his
arrival at the scene.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="wn">LEGAL REDRESS.</span></h2>

<p class="pp10s p1">‘O thou dread Power! whose empire-giving hand<br />
Has oft been stretched to shield the honored land!’</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">So</span> trivial a quarrel as that narrated in the closing part of
our last chapter, had it occurred elsewhere than in a community
in which the inhabitants had so recently sustained
the relations of masters and slaves, would scarcely have
elicited remark upon a subsequent day; but over the three
or four hundred colored, and forty or fifty white residents
of Baconsville there settled a dark cloud of anxiety and
apprehension of coming evil.</p>

<p>Angry looks and threats of violence on the part of the
whites were recalled and anxiously discussed by the colored
people, as were also the recent and frequently expressed
determination to “carry the next election for the Democratic
Party, if even through blood waist deep,” though
the colored voters were largely in the majority, and almost
without exception, if unintimidated, voted the Republican
ticket.</p>

<p>These, with the oft-repeated boast that the illegal Rifle
Clubs, trained cavalry companies, were ready to co-operate
for the suppression and utter dispersion of this colored
company of State militia, with the fact that similar acts
of violence were by no means new experiences to the ex-slaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in the South, but were even then being perpetrated in
the surrounding country, made the outlook for the colored
population gloomy, indeed.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the officers of the town, with the
single exception of our friend Marmor, were all of the colored
race, and as he was a Republican native, he was
even more repugnant to his white neighbors than a
“nigger.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, during the two months preceding
this encounter, these militia-men were known to have been
drilling as often as once or twice a week, though the law required
such practice but once a month. This alarmed the
whites, with whom anticipations of “insurrections” are still
either congenital or feigned.</p>

<p>In the days of slavery, and also by the South Carolina
“Black Code” (the only exclusively white legislation in the
State since reconstruction), arms were strictly forbidden
to the negroes, and under heavy penalties; yet, through
the subsequent Republican legislation, they rejoiced in being
the “National Guards,” bearing the same flag which
Sherman “carried down to the sea,” and under which Captain
Doc learned tactics and heroism in the “Black Regiment,”
which once swept over Fort Fisher, and closed the
last port of the rebellious States.</p>

<p>What signified it to those conscience-accused whites that
these were poor men maneuvering by the light of the moon
to save the expense of lighting their drill room; and, unable
to spare time from their toil, they took it from the hours of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
their rest, to prepare for a creditable performance on the
Nation’s Centennial birthday? So much the worse. The
Fourth of July was the birthday of the “national nonsense”
that “all men are created equal;” and it was not
the fault or credit of these white men that there was left a
nation to celebrate its Centennial.</p>

<p>Now that the sole militia of the State was enrolled from
this emancipated race (white men would not enlist under
charters, because unassured that they should not be subordinated
to colored officers, and they might be required to
sustain a State government of the colored majority), how
should one expect the former masters to be content and
at ease, even though no concerted outbreak had ever
occurred among the freedmen, whose temper is naturally
peaceable and timid even to servility?</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the fears of those once reputed hard masters,
or who still find it difficult to conform to the new conditions,
are often distressing. They are also nature’s incontrovertible
testimony to the wisdom and divine origin
of equal rights.</p>

<p>Great was the excitement of the Baker families when
the young men arrived with the tale of their “narrow escape
from the militia men.”</p>

<p>Early the next morning, the old slave-hunter and his
three sons set out for the office of Trial Justice Rives, who,
though a colored man, it was thought could be more easily
induced to meet out punishment to those miserable offenders,
than Louis Marmor, who was the only other competent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
magistrate in the town.</p>

<p>Of course, as has been the custom of the whites there,
from the earliest settlement of that country, these gentlemen
all wore their side-arms, and for greater safety these
were put into the very best condition, and fully loaded, as
they suspected the Town Marshal, who ran after them on
the previous evening, might attempt a counter-arrest for
the same offense.</p>

<p>Young Tommy did not feel quite safe from Dan Pipsie
without his eighteen-shooting rifle in addition; and so,
with it in hand, he mounted his young bay horse, while beside
him rode his brother-in-law, Harry Gaston,&mdash;the best
shot in town, bearing also his carbine; while the father and
his eldest son, Hanson, were seated in a light wagon in
which were placed additional firearms, lightly covered with
a lap-robe.</p>

<p>Thus equipped, they proceeded in safety, through the
quiet little village to the Justice’s office; and finding it
closed, went two miles further on, to his plantation, and
returned with him to his office; quite a formidable party to
be sure. Arrived there, they entered complaints against
Dan Pipsie for threats to kill, and against the officers of the
Militia Company for “obstructing the highway.”</p>

<p>The Justice, being himself Major-general of that division
of the State Militia, after thoughtfully scratching his crispy
locks awhile, said:</p>

<p>“I reckon it is best to hear a <i>statement</i> of the testimony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and then decide whether it is a case for court-martialing,
or for trial under the <i>civil law</i>.”</p>

<p>Ten o’clock of the next morning was fixed as the time
for hearing the case.</p>

<p>At that hour Justice Rives was found seated behind his
desk, and busily examining papers and documents.</p>

<p>The Bakers made their appearance, accompanied by a
few friends, among whom were two professional men&mdash;a
Reverend, and an M. D.; though not with compresses and
consolations for the possible wounded and dying, (for South
Carolina chivalry does not fight its duels with “niggers,”)
but with bail money (modified from bullets), should that
counter-arrest, which they feared, be attempted.</p>

<p>Automatically, or through force of habit, each race in
the southern States still assumes, in assemblies, the positions
and attitudes imposed in the days of slavery. In the
churches of the colored people one or more of the most
desirable seats are reserved for whites, and these often remain
vacant, or nearly so, during a lengthy service, while
church members stand to exhaustion for want of seats.</p>

<p>Hence, the front seats of Gen. Justice Rives’ court-room
were occupied by the plaintiffs and their friends, and the
defendants and their friends sat at a respectful distance in
the rear, while a number of boys and women of color
gathered outside of the door.</p>

<p>The magistrate, who had not altogether escaped the envy
of his less fortunate neighbors, had often been accused by
them of a sycophantic weakness for the approval of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
whites; while the latter declared that justice could not be
obtained by them before a colored officer, and that, as a
political canvass was approaching, they would not again
submit to negro magistrates.</p>

<p>He therefore felt his position peculiarly trying, especially
when he saw that they were all thoroughly armed.</p>

<p>He held both his official positions by appointments of the
Governor, to be sure; yet he knew that the preponderance
of wealth, intelligence and bravery was with the white
race; while at the same time he did not forget that if “a
traitor to his race,” he would probably, through ostracism
and insult, reap a bitter retribution from his own people.</p>

<p>A peace warrant was, however, soon issued against Dan
Pipsie, his “Daddy” being present to give bail for his
future good behavior. Then, with some apparent reluctance
and nervousness, the Justice called the principal case.</p>

<p>Mr. Watta arose and announced that lawyer Kanrasp,
from the county seat would appear for the defense.</p>

<p>To this Robert Baker strenuously objected, as, not having
been advised that attorneys would be employed, he had
none. He therefore asked a postponement of the case.</p>

<p>Kanrasp then suggested to his client that inasmuch as
the proceedings had thus far been very informal&mdash;the paper
served being neither a writ nor summons, and not at
all a legal paper&mdash;he would withdraw from the case, and
let Rives take judgment if he chose, when the case could be
appealed to the Superior Court, where justice might be
had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>This he did on account of the extreme indignation manifested
by the Bakers and their friends.</p>

<p>Gaston, who was a shriveled, weason-faced specimen of the
<i>genus homo</i>, with sandy hair, flaming whiskers, and a face
in which whiskey held a profusion of freckles in purple
solution, was the first to testify, which he did in accordance
with his views of the affair.</p>

<p>“Now, Captain,” said the Judge, when Gaston had finished,
“as you have no counsel, you may question the
witness if you want to.”</p>

<p>Captain Doc was a well-made, medium sized and shrewd
man, little less than forty years of age, with very dark
complexion, having three-fourths African blood.</p>

<p>He arose from his seat quite slowly, and squarely fronting
Gaston, asked:</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaston, did I treat yo’ with any disrespect when I
spoke to yo’? Didn’t I treat yo’ politely?”</p>

<p>“I ca’n’t say that you treated me with any disrespect;
but I can say this much, that there was two or three members
of your company that showed some impudence to me,
and I also saw them load their guns.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaston,” replied the Captain, looking searchingly
in the eyes of the little man, “didn’t yo’ see me examining
the cartridge-boxes and the pockets of the company, to see
if they had any ammunition before we went on drill?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“Did yo’ see any?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>I</i> did. I found one man with a cartridge in his pocket,
and I took it away, and scolded him about it.”</p>

<p>Gaston replied, “Yes, I saw that.”</p>

<p>“Well then, are yo’ <i>certain</i> that these men loaded their
guns?”</p>

<p>“I saw them moving them, and I thought they were
loading them.”</p>

<p>“And so yo’ came here to <i>swear</i> that we wanted to kill
yo’? That’s about as much as a colored man can get for
his care not to give offense. A man is a fool to go out of
his way for any of yo’ white folks anyway. Yo’ had no
right to aim to drive through our Company as yo’ did; but
when I gave in and got out of yo’r way, and let you go
‘long&mdash;gave yo’ the road that b’longed to us&mdash;yo’ just come
heah with such a lie as that against us.”</p>

<p>“Captain, I don’t want you to treat my court with contempt,”
said Rives, severely. “If you can’t address the
gentleman more politely you must sit down.”</p>

<p>“Judge, I don’t mean no contempt,” said Doc, in a conciliatory
tone, “not if I know myself. I never expect to
treat no lawful court with any contempt. I was only asking
questions, but if the questions is not legal, then I don’t
want to ask him. I won’t ask no mo’, but leave it to yo’r
discretion,” and he sat down.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, to sit down without permission is contempt
of court.”</p>

<p>With such an air of drollery as only a negro can assume,
Doc sprung to his feet again, saying&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yo’ mus’ pardon me sah. I’s not accustomed to law
offices. If sitting down or anything else is contempt, I’m
asking yo’r pardon this minute; for I didn’t mean to contempt
this court.”</p>

<p>“It is contempt, sir!” thundered the judge, “and I put
you under arrest, and dismiss this court till July the 8th
at four o’clock in the evening.”</p>

<p>Some protestations were made on account of the lateness
of the hour, but Rives insisted he could not leave his plantation
labor earlier, and immediately declared the court
adjourned.</p>

<p>Neither the day nor hour was satisfactory to the complainants,
as it was on Saturday afternoon, when many
country negroes were certain to visit the village shops,
stores, and market; but as the whites were more generally
masters of their own time, it is possible Rives feared he
might need the presence and support of his own race
should he not condemn the accused.</p>

<p>Harry Gaston was enraged and strutted about like a
bantam cock; his face became almost livid, and his hands
nervously bobbed in and out of the breast pockets of his
short coat, where rested a well-prepared pistol on one side,
and a flask of whiskey on the other. Alas, the <i>flask</i> knew
little rest.</p>

<p>“I pray you be calm, my dear nephew,” said the Reverend
Mr. Mealy, who, though inwardly <i>seething</i>, was so enswathed
in his own innate mealiness, that he was measurably
cool. “Do not allow this degraded black to disturb you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Remember your position in society. You have been raised
by me as my own son. Do not disgrace yourself and me
by condescending to dispute with one in his station, and of
his color,” and grasping the young man’s arm, he moved
towards the door.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Watta, who had been sitting beside his Captain,
now sprung to his feet, and grasping Doc’s arm,
rushed towards the door, attempting to lead him out.</p>

<p>Doc, however, hung back, and having extricated himself,
said in a low tone, “Watta, keep cool!” and he sat down
again.</p>

<p>“I won’t keep cool!” retorted the lieutenant. This white-livered
judge has shown partiality. Look at the arms in
this court room! and Rives is afraid!” (with a sneer.) “They
may shed my blood if they can, but I won’t keep still and
see my captain arrested for contempt just because in questioning,
he got ahead of these unrebuked and cowardly bullies
when you humbled us all, on the Fourth of July, to avoid
a fuss and concilliate their lordships;” and the enraged man
strode out of the building, threw the gate back upon its
hinges, and standing in the opening thus made, drew himself
to his full height, and threw out his empty palms exclaiming</p>

<p>“I carry no arms; but we’ve got arms.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’ve got arms, but you’ll see how it’ll be
yourselves!” said Hanson Baker, who had been haranguing
the people outside the court house. “There’s
a fellow from Texas here, two or more of ’em, and they’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
going to kill that Town Marshall, and nobody isn’t going
to know who done it, and then they’ll leave.”</p>

<p>“What does he or they know about John Carr, the Marshall?”
asked a very large, but irresolute-looking black man.</p>

<p>“He’s been informed of his character, and I tell you
John Carr won’t be living in this town three months, neither
will some o’ the rest.”</p>

<p>“How about that Harmony Case?” asked the same voice
(a case of massacre of blacks).</p>

<p>“Well, I wasn’t there, but they done it, and there’s a
programme laid down for the white folks <i>this</i> year.”</p>

<p>“That is wrong,” said a voice.</p>

<p>“Well, if it <i>is</i> wrong, it is no matter; it’ll be done all the
same. There is no laws now.”</p>

<p>“Ha! ha!” laughed the crowd, the whites applauding,
and the blacks deriding the threats.</p>

<p>“Does yo’ pretend to say there a’n’t no law in the State
now?”</p>

<p>“No, there a’n’t no law in this State, nor any other State.
It’s been a hundred years since the Constitution of the
United States, and it’s played out now, and every man can
do as he likes. We’re going to get Chamberlain and his
crowd out o’ the State House.”</p>

<p>“How about Grant? You know he’s President.”</p>

<p>“By&mdash;&mdash;! we’ll have him too.”</p>

<p>“Take care, that is treason,” said another.</p>

<p>Harrison Baker and Watta proceeded, each with his harangue,
and paid no heed to each other, till the plaintiffs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and their friends crowded out of the building, pistols in
hand, ready for instantaneous use.</p>

<p>A frightened old mammy bawled out, with great eyes
rolling, and great hands waving, “See the pistols and guns!
See the pistols and guns! Oh, Lor’! they ort to be shot
down theirselves!” but the next instant she cowered under
the same fierce gaze of the “old man Baker,” which had
made many a stalwart runaway stand tamely after the dogs
were taken off and while the shackles were put on.</p>

<p>“Uncle, Uncle, let me go,” said Gaston impatiently, striving
to free himself from that worthy’s grasp. “I want to
shut that yellow chap’s mouth with this little bit of lead.
The judge ought to arrest <i>him</i>, but I’ll take his case if
you’ll let me go, I’ll give him a mouthful to chaw!”</p>

<p>“Shut my mouth, would you?” retorted Watta, who had
caught the words as the two men approached the door.
“You’ll find that hard business before you are through with
it, if you try. The whites have ruled us long enough.
Two hundred and fifty years they bought and sold us like
cattle, till the United States set us free; and since then,
colored citizens have been tied and whipped, and shot, and
murdered in cold blood, and driven from their homes, and
their property destroyed, to this day. But it is all no matter
here before this white-livered judge. It’ll take a regiment
to tie and whip <i>me</i>, or spill what black blood <i>I</i>
have.”</p>

<p>“Do not speak to him, my nephew,” said the Rev. Mr.
Mealy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“A regiment!” cried Gaston, with a sneer. “Let me go
and whip him myself;” but the readiness with which he
yielded to the pressure of his uncle’s hands, was amusingly
in contrast with his words.</p>

<p>“We will have this matter settled by law now, and know
whether we are to be run over in this way. We will
know which are to rule this place&mdash;the blacks or the whites,”
said Rev. Mr. Mealy. “We’ll know what rights this militia
company have. They have got an idea that they can do
whatever they please. We’ll have it settled now.”</p>

<p>“This court is a mockery of justice,” continued Watta.
“Look at those arms on the side of wealth, and an unarmed
poor man arrested for contempt, because he has a dark skin
and cornered his opponent by lawful questions. The next
time a white swell rides into our ranks while we are on
parade we will see that he doesn’t take us to court for obstructing
his way.”</p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Mealy, Dr. Shall, and General Rives were
active and nearest in efforts to control the now highly incensed
Baker family and Gaston; and an influential colored
man succeeded in getting Watta out of the street. With
deep muttered threats and oaths, the Bakers and their
friends at length betook themselves to their conveyances
and their homes.</p>

<p>Captain Doc conversed with the constable, in the justice’s
office, while the latter official went to his dinner and returned.
Re-entering, Rives approached, and extending his
hand said good-humoredly, “Shake hands Doc.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied he, with averted eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, you will. I couldn’t help it. You was bearing
on so hard that they would have shot you in two minutes
more. I did it to save you.”</p>

<p>“Is that so, judge? Then here’s my hand. I didn’t
mean no contempt; but if I’ve contempted you, or your
court I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right now, and I’ll remit the fine. Now let
me tell you, you’d best settle this matter somehow, if it is
possible. I’m afraid trouble will come of this. I wish
Watta had ’a’ kept still.”</p>

<p>“So do I. He’s a marked man now, shor’, and his life
an’t worth much,” said Nat Wellman, the constable.</p>

<p>“Settle it?” said Capt. Doc. “Major General Rives, nothing
will settle it but to let the company be broken up. I
won’t do that, and my oath to the State, that I have taken as
Captain, wonldn’t let me if I wanted to.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see the end of this yet, I can’t,” said the Judge,
with a sigh, as the trio separated.</p>

“Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world,<br />
Like a Colossus; and we petty men<br />
Walk under his huge legs, and peep about<br />
To find ourselves dishonorable graves.”</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">Casca, in Julius Caesar.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> 8th of July, 1876, was an exceedingly hot day,
and few white residents of the State of South Carolina
ventured out of doors in the hotter hours, though, as is
usual, the colored race needed less caution to avoid sunstroke.</p>

<p>About nine o’clock, A. M., two gentlemen issued from an
attractive residence, which was situated on a slight eminence
on the outskirts of a little village called Enfield Court-House.
Leaving the broad piazza, they walked leisurely
down the gently sloping lawn to the street. As they
closed the gate behind them a covered buggy passed, in
which was seated a middle-aged man who bore a decidedly
commanding air.</p>

<p>His hat lay upon the seat beside him, and the light hot
breeze lifted the long iron-gray hair which lay upon
his shoulders, and fluttered his linen duster and the loose
flapping curtains of the carriage with a cool and comfortable
appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>His horse was fresh, and so spirited that the neatly-gloved
hands of the gentleman were well-exercised in controlling
him.</p>

<p>He found time to gaze at the two gentlemen upon the
ground, however, but gave no sign of recognition, save
possibly a little more lofty elevation of the head.</p>

<p>“The General is off on professional business, judging
from his manner and duster,” remarked the elder of the
two pedestrians.</p>

<p>“I often find it hard to repress a smile, even in his presence,
at his <i>wondrous pomposity</i>. What kind of a business
would he do in the North&mdash;Ohio, say&mdash;with all his airs?
He wouldn’t have a client.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he would. There are plenty of people everywhere,
who never know what estimate to put upon others
till they, or some one else tell them. But the General’s
“airs,” as you call them, are his stock in trade here.”</p>

<p>Both men laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“But to think of a man passing his neighbor and State
Senator as he did you, Mr. Cone! He should respect your
office, at least.”</p>

<p>“Ah! that’s what he does not do when a radical is the
incumbent. He was once quite condescending and affable
to me, when I let politics and education alone, and didn’t
meddle with them at all.”</p>

<p>“Meddle! Senator! Who has a better right than you
to take an interest in politics?”</p>

<p>“Young man you forget yourself, you must learn meekness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and discretion&mdash;not to put too fine a point on it&mdash;or
you will get into trouble.”</p>

<p>“But we are immensely in the majority,&mdash;the State is
really in our hands. Why should we cringle and bow to
this haughty minority just because the blood of their
families, is in our veins, mixed with various proportions of
African?”</p>

<p>“But you’re a ‘nigger’!”</p>

<p>“True, and they used to say that black men had no
rights that white men were bound to respect. That was
their day. This is ours.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but I want a better pattern for my life than they
have been. I say, because we are in the majority, let us
take all the honors and offices we can, but wear them
meekly for our safety’s sake, and fill them honorably for
conscience’s sake. Good morning!” and the twain separated
to go, the one to his law studies, and the other to his
duties as planter and legislator.</p>

<p>We will accompany the General. Right through the
torrid heat he kept on, over hill and valley, only stopping
occasionally to cool his reeking horse in the shade of some
friendly tree, or to converse with some white man whose
house he entered briefly, or whom he beckoned to his carriage
if within call.</p>

<p>At length he descended a long hill, and, reining his
horse below the bridge, he drove into a small stream,
where, in the shade of some overhanging trees, he paused
a few moments, allowing his horse to drink while he hastily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
pencilled a few figures in his notebook. Adding them up
he shook his head thoughtfully, and said, in a low tone:
“That will not do. Which way next?”</p>

<p>On looking up, he descried a horseman descending the
hill before him. Driving out of the water, and regaining
the road, he awaited his approach.</p>

<p>“Howdy do, General?” said the equestrian, pausing
beside the carriage. “Hot day this.”</p>

<p>“Infernally hot, Dr. Wise!” and he grasped the extended
hand, as he wiped the perspiration from his face and neck
with his left, and, though apparently irritated by the heat,
he shook hands cordially.</p>

<p>“It <i>is</i> hot here, hot as that hottest of all places, and I
hear they are going to have that over here in Baconsville
pretty soon; I hear so,” and the Doctor shook his fat sides
with a chuckling laugh, adding: “You must have important
business to call you out to-day.”</p>

<p>“It is quite important, <i>quite</i>,” replied General Baker.
“I have got a suit on hand in Baconsville that is quite
important, and if that other place you are talking about
comes there, I hope I shall not find it hotter than this hollow
is. Niggers may stand it, but I cannot.”</p>

<p>Both gentlemen were delighted and laughed loudly.</p>

<p>“I’ve just come from there,” said Dr. Wise.</p>

<p>“From where&mdash;Baconsville? or the other hot place?”</p>

<p>“Oh, from Baconsville,” replied the medical man, laughing.
“I couldn’t have got away from the other place with
all this fat.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The laugh again subsiding, he continued: “You see I
have a patient I am watching over there; and being in the
neighborhood, was called in to see two or three of the better
class of colored people. I’m afraid you’ll have trouble,
there, at that suit. The niggers are saucy, and very angry
about that collision between the Bakers and the militia.”</p>

<p>“Well, Doctor, the colored people in South Carolina have
become so insolent and insurrectionary, and intractable, and
have taken on so many intolerable airs, that they must be
made to know their places. You will see their wenches on
the streets of Augusta and Charleston, and all our cities,
with their “pin-backs” and “button shoes,” and “bustles,”
and indeed imitating our ladies in everything; and
they even act as though they expected a white man to step
aside and let them pass, as if they were the ladies themselves.
I saw an affair in Charleston the other day that
<i>made my blood boil</i>, and I involuntarily laid my hand
upon my pistol, but fortunately I was preserved from using
it.</p>

<p>“Three great black&mdash;<i>creatures</i>, I suppose I must call
them <i>men</i>&mdash;were walking up the street, and met three
young ladies whom I know to be members of one of our
best families. What do you think but that these impudent
brutes actually crowded our ladies into the gutter&mdash;made
them actually step off the pavement for want of room to
pass! Quite fortunately the ditch was dry, and not deep&mdash;four
or five inches, at most. But such indignities are too
great a tax on the forbearance of a gentleman of gallantry!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Only one of the ladies actually stepped off, but then, time
was when I could have blown out the brains of all three of
the rascals, and the community and the State would have
sustained me. But those were days of “home rule.” Alas!
when shall we ever see them again!</p>

<p>“I do not know what they are meditating at Baconsville,
but I hear they have been performing military evolutions,
with arms in their hands, two or three times a week,
recently, and at night too; and I am called over to put a
stop to it. Why, we are not safe in our beds! It is one
of the atrocities of our carpet-bag government that they
are allowed arms <i>at all</i>, and now they have attacked our
people.”</p>

<p>“Now, you don’t say so, General!” exclaimed the Doctor.</p>

<p>“To be sure! This case of mine would bear that construction;
though Mr. Robert Baker has, in the absence of
counsel, very mildly, and I fear unwisely, put it on the
ground of ‘obstructing the highway.’ He might have
made a case much stronger, for they obstructed the way
with their guns and bayonets, and Gaston says some of
them, at least, were seen to load their guns on the spot.”</p>

<p>“It is a case of positive violence, then, and insurrection?”</p>

<p>“Oh, positive insubordination,” said the General, with
great emphasis and indignation. “And they have been
making such threats that I’m called over to see if there is
any redress possible&mdash;any law or means by which they can
be restrained.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“If anybody can straighten them out, <i>you</i> can, General;
whether it is to be done by law or by force of arms. We
haven’t forgotten your record in the Confederate service.
But have you no help? You will need backing, I fear.”</p>

<p>“I have called upon several gentlemen along the way,
and interested them and their clubs, I think; and the club at
Enfield promise to come over to my assistance one hundred
strong at least. But I have just been computing and could
desire even a larger force, especially should the Judge decide
adversely to us; for something <i>must</i> be done to insure
our protection. I confess I feel some concern.”</p>

<p>“On reflection, I think you need not, General, for the
community is fully aroused by a report that the negroes
intend to <i>mob</i> those young men.”</p>

<p>“Mob them!” ejaculated General Baker, with an oath.
“They will scarcely dare to do that. They know my military
reputation too well to try that, and I shall be prepared
for them, now that you have kindly forewarned me. But to
be so Doctor, I must bid you good-day, and hasten forward,
for a good seven miles lies before me yet.”</p>

<p>“I have great confidence in your ability to command success,
and am sure the darkies have a wholesome respect for
the same. So, wishing you all success, I also bid you
good-day.”</p>

<p>The General now called more frequently upon the white
people along the way, but soon found them anticipating his
coming and ready to join him soon; forming quite an escort
of cavalry as they proceeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>It was two o’clock and intensely hot when they arrived
at Sommer Hill, and found about one hundred and fifty
men grouped in the shade of two wide-spreading oak trees
near a church there, and around a grog shop opposite.</p>

<p>The General’s arrival was greeted with three cheers, three
times repeated, and three “tigers;” and the men, anxious to
do him honor, pressed around his carriage to shake his
hand and assure him that they still cherished the recollections
of his gallantry on behalf of the “lost cause.”</p>

<p>Though quite animated, this scene was brief, for courteously
declining the scores of invitations to “drink,” General
Baker informed his followers that the call to duty was
still more imperative to his mind than those to eat or
drink, and he must hasten forward to consult with his clients
before the hour for court arrived.</p>

<p>Directing them to remain there till signaled, and to keep
an outlook from the brow of the hill overlooking Baconsville,
two miles away, he bravely rode thitherward entirely
unattended, notwithstanding the earnest protestations
of his numerous friends.</p>

<p>“So brave a man who can decline such entreaties to drink,
and as gracefully as the General did, ought to be at the
head of a temperance society,” said a young man, lounging
near the church.</p>

<p>“That’s so, Jimminy!” replied a comrade. “Wonder if
he isn’t.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not. I suppose he takes his wine, and probably
something stronger sometimes; though he wants a cool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
head now. I wish those fellows over there wouldn’t drink
so. I’m for breaking up the nigger militia; but we want
cool heads for it. We can <i>scare</i> the niggers out of it if we
work it right, and all keep sober.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I think, but you see already how it will be.
I would go home and give it up, but they’ll say I was
afraid. I don’t want to get into no collisions with the
United States, for my part; and if a lot of them get drunk,
I’m afraid something will be done that will lead to that.”</p>

<p>Less than half a mile from where this conversation was
passing, Harry Gaston sat in his shady porch.</p>

<p>“Don’t set there doing nothing but watching,” said a
tall lean young woman who sat just inside of the door,
busying herself by rocking in an easy chair. “The General
will think yo’ reckon on ’im awfully, an’ he’s conceited
enough now, mercy knows! There, take them old papers
of yo’re uncle’s, and make as if yo’ was studying politics on
yo’ own hook;” and she tossed a handful of newspapers
upon the floor beside him.</p>

<p>He took up a copy of that celebrated democratic organ
of the South, the Charleston <i>News and Courier</i>, dated May,
1875, and read&mdash;</p>

<p>“Governor Chamberlain richly deserves the confidence
of the people of this State. The people of South Carolina,
who have all at stake, who see and hear what persons outside
the State cannot know, are satisfied with his honesty.
They believe in him as well they may.”</p>

<p>“Bah! the contemptible carpet-bagger!” said Gaston,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
dashing the paper on the floor; and picking up another,
dated February, 1876, he read again&mdash;</p>

<p>“We believe that, without regard to consequences or to
his party, he (the Governor) will go on in the narrow path
of right.”</p>

<p>Another&mdash;“January, 1876. In South Carolina the conspicuous
leader in the fight for reform, the one man who
has made reform possible at an early day, is Governor
Chamberlain, whose election was the greatest blessing in
disguise that this people has ever known.”</p>

<p>“The greatest curse!” exclaimed Gaston kicking the
paper off the porch.</p>

<p>“That the <i>Courier</i>?” drawled Mrs. Gaston. “I thought
that used to be the best paper in the South&mdash;true to the
Confederacy all through the war. Has it gone over to the
Radicals?”</p>

<p>“It don’t pretend so, but it has been bribed, I reckon.”</p>

<p>A voice from the highway, now called the husband
away to hold a brief colloquy with General Baker.</p>

<p>“My horse is very tired and warm, and I myself am in
need of refreshment; so, Mr. Gaston, I shall be obliged if
you will strike across the fields and notify your father-in-law
of my arrival, and bring him and your brother-in-law,
Tom, to the store of Mr. Dunn to meet me for conference
about the suit we have in hand,” and the great man drove on.</p>

<p>“Mary, General Baker wants me to go across the fields
to your father’s for him,” said the young man, with a demure
countenance, on re-entering the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I reckon yo’ won’t do no such a thing!” she replied,
forcibly. “A mighty easy thing it would be for
some nigger to pop you over, and nobody to see. Yo’
won’t go that way.”</p>

<p>“I’ll just gallop down the other road and get to the village
ahead o’ the General; Tom’s thar’, we can go together
after the old man; though I a’n’t afraid of the niggers.”</p>

<p>“See! see! Meester Dunn,” said that worthy’s helpful
“frau,” as they sat at their dinner in a room immediately
in the rear of their grocery. “Dar is Shinneral Paker from
Enefield, an’ er pe shtopping right here! Pe quick, now.
My laws! but dis vill pe ine goot ebening by de bar! De
Shenneral shtop ’ere, an’ all de gem’mans and companies
come, too! Hurry, now Shorge!”</p>

<p>“Dat alle right now. I fix ’m mit ole Bob gester-tag,”
said the shrewd though moderate husband, George, arising
from the table, and shuffling through the glass door by
which the dining-room and grocery (or more accurately
<i>groggery</i>), communicated, he greeted the great military
dignity with a volume of broken English that was almost
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Shaking the dust from his apparel, the distinguished
guest ordered food and drink for his beast, after time given
him to cool; adding that he would refresh himself while
waiting for the appearance of his clients.</p>

<p>“Alle right! alle right! De ole voman vill serve you,”
replied Dunn, as he followed his colored servant and the
weary horse to the stables.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Gaston and Tommy were by this time crossing the great
truck-farm of Robert Baker, every rood of which was purchased
with the earnings of trained blood-hounds, chasing
fugitives from justice or labor, and mainly the latter.</p>

<p>In a sag of land, between the hills on the right and the
river on the left, was a brickyard, in the office of which
Mr. Robert Baker and his son Hanson were found.</p>

<p>The four men were soon <i>en route</i> for Baconsville. A
colored boy, bound apprentice to the older Baker, skulked
along the crooked fence by the wayside.</p>

<p>“Joe,” said the old man, stopping the horse, “Joe, come
here.” The personal appearance and reputation of the old
man, and recollections of a recent chastisement for drumming
for the militia company, made little Joe’s dark skin
quiver as he timidly approached the vehicle.</p>

<p>“Get in,” said the same gruff voice, as room was made
for the child at Baker’s feet, where he gathered himself
into the smallest possible ball, from which two great, soft,
timid eyes looked from one face to another, and from the two
glittering guns of the young men who rode on either side,
and the pistol-shaped lumps on the left breasts of their thin
coats, to the breasts of the two men fronting him in the
carriage, where he could see two more bright and shining
“nine-shooters” peeping out.</p>

<p>The wind presently raised a paper from a basket standing
beside him, and disclosed two great horse-pistols lying
on a clean white napkin.</p>

<p>“I wonder is dey gwoine to shoot Doc and Watta wid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
dem ’ar’, as Ned Dunn said dey is?” thought the child.
“Dat looks like dar’s a mighty nice lunch undah ’em, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Hanson Baker jerked the lap-robe from his knees, and
covered the basket from view.</p>

<p>They soon reached Dunn’s store, and alighted, and removing
the basket, bade Joe return with the horse and
carriage, and remember to stay there closely.</p>

<p>As they sat in close conversation in the back part of that
groggery, while the General partook of the “nice lunch”
the basket did contain, it was plain that “Old Bob Baker,
the slave catcher,” and the aristocratic General had little
in common except their patronymic and their political
opinions and ideas.</p>

<span class="wn">THE CLOUD THICKENS.</span></h2>

<p class="pp10q p1">“Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look;<br />
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.<br />
Fear him not, Cæsar, he’s not dangerous;<br />
He is a noble Roman and well given.”</p>
<p class="pr4">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Julius Cæsar.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> State of South Carolina was settled by political
refugees and desperadoes of every description and from
every nation, with no unity of ideas or interests; and
African slavery was introduced but two years after the
first settlement had secured a permanent footing. Hence,
arrogance and oppression, rapacity and murder, early
became the rule and occupation of the people.</p>

<p>The existence and perpetuation of slavery during more
than eight generations caused and necessitated an arrest of
progress in civilization, and the war which resulted in the
emancipation of the slaves and the re-establishment of the
Union, found the whites in several of the Southern States,
in many respects not far in advance of the people of England
in the sixteenth century; and as those feudalistic and
inharmonious families&mdash;the descendants of the earliest settlers&mdash;are
still recognized as “the first families,” the “aristocracy
of the State”&mdash;in the year of our Lord 1876, and
of the Republic one hundred&mdash;boasting and bravado were
accomplishments ostentatiously displayed there, and often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
sustained by such brutal assault and lawless violence and
outrage, as those of the worst days of feudalism.</p>

<p>This state of society alone explains the temerity of the
threats and preparations for violence, and their fearful
consummation, which blacken the history of the Republic’s
centennial year.</p>

<p>While Robert Baker and his sons were in Dunn’s groggery,
informing their counsel respecting the particulars of
the suit he was about to conduct for them, many exciting
scenes were transpiring in the vicinity, and the streets of
the doomed village were becoming lively with the presence
of armed men, who were freely imbibing whisky, and
threatening to “kill every &mdash;&mdash; nigger in Baconsville that
day.” Especially loud and frequent were the threats
against the Captain and Second Lieutenant of the militia
company.</p>

<p>As soon as half-past three o’clock, quite a crowd had
gathered around George Dunn’s store, and the bar was evidently
reaping the rich harvest Mrs. D. had anticipated;
while with loud and excessively revolting profanity, the
case shortly to be tried was canvassed, and rumors of a
“negro insurrection” rehearsed.</p>

<p>“Who is that coming?” asked one, as a quiet man of
medium size approached.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is Judge Kanrasp of the county seat, he is
a cursed Northern Republican,” was the reply, accompanied
by a shocking oath.</p>

<p>The wrathful eyes of the entire crowd were fixed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
him as he came up, and, entering the store, approached the
place where the two Bakers sat, and addressing the General
said, “Mr. Gaston informed me that you wished to see
me.”</p>

<p>This was not his first interview with Mr. <i>Robert</i> Baker
in connection with this difficulty. The latter had stopped
him that morning upon the streets of the city opposite, to
speak of the pending trial.</p>

<p>The Judge had then stated his opinion that Gaston’s
testimony had thus far developed no legal case against the
colored men, and urged the abandonment of the case, as to
push it further, would merely excite ill-feeling between the
two races at a time when it was most undesirable&mdash;at the
commencement of a political campaign&mdash;and even should
the plaintiffs secure a judgment, it was a matter which
could be appealed, and in a higher court their case could
not stand a moment.</p>

<p>“I shall do no such thing,” replied Mr. Baker. “The
negroes of Baconsville have been very offensive; they
have interfered with my sons, and I am <i>determined that
they shall be punished. The case shall be prosecuted</i>, and
so far as any feeling is concerned, I don’t care for that.
Some of my friends and neighbors from the country have
been informed that the trial will take place this evening,
and they will be present, not less than twenty-five or thirty
of them.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Baker, perhaps there will be two or three hundred,”
said Kanrasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, yes (with an oath), two or three thousand!” and
the two men separated, and the Judge at once crossed the
river to Baconsville, and confidentially communicated all
to a discreet colored man there, in whose cool, quiet determination
he had great confidence; commissioning him to
see the officers of the militia company, and instruct them
to present themselves at the Court, submit to judgment
whatever it might be, and then, by an appeal to a higher
court, find an easy way out of the difficulty; as the “precept”
or informal paper which had been served upon them,
must cause the judgment to fail there; and stating that in
case of an attempted defense before Justice Rives, he
apprehended serious trouble from the throng that would
undoubtedly be present.</p>

<p>Other important business detained both Kanrasp and
his influential friend Springer till the middle of the afternoon,
when, on re-entering the street, they saw the village
thickly besprinkled with squads of men from the rifle clubs
of the vicinity. These clubs or military companies existed
in open defiance of law and the Governor’s prohibitive
proclamation.</p>

<p>“This looks like trouble,” said Judge Kanrasp to his
friend. “Strange way to attend a simple trial! Now go
right up and see those officers <i>immediately</i>, and urge
them to be on hand at court, and stand judgment.” So
saying he went to Marmor’s office upon other business,
where Gaston soon rode up, bringing Gen. Baker’s request
for the interview, to which we find him responding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am here to represent my cousin, Mr. Robert Baker,
in this matter,” said the General, “and wish you, Mr. Kanrasp,
to sit down and tell me what it is.”</p>

<p>Judge K. complied, adding the advice he had given his
clients.</p>

<p>“We have been annoyed a great deal by the negroes
about here, and I am determined to get satisfaction, and
Gen. Baker has been brought here as my attorney, to see
that satisfaction is given us,” said Robert Baker, in a loud
and vehement tone.</p>

<p>“Now, Judge Kanrasp,” said the General, “will you not
go and see those officers of this company and request them
to call upon me? I desire to tell them what I think is
necessary for them to do to prevent the possibility of difficulty
in the future. A great deal of feeling has been
growing between Mr. Robert Baker’s family and immediate
neighbors, and these colored people in Baconsville.”</p>

<p>“What proposition do you make them?”</p>

<p>“Well, I think it will be necessary for them to apologize
to my cousin and surrender their arms.”</p>

<p>As he did not say to whom their arms should be surrendered,
the Judge replied&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Well, General, you know I am, like yourself, merely an
incident in Baconsville; and whilst I have, of course, a certain
amount of influence with the colored people, on
account of my political affiliations with them, I cannot
undertake to say that they will respond to your request. I
will do what I can to induce them to do so. But suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
these negotiations and propositions fail, is it likely that
that there will be a collision?”</p>

<p>“I think there will.”</p>

<p>“Well, as I am one of a very few white ‘radicals’
here, if a collision takes place I suppose I shall stand a
pretty poor chance.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt that you will.”</p>

<p>Shortly after Judge K. left Mr. Marmor’s office (which
adjoined his dwelling), Capt. Doc, Lieut. Watta, Mr.
Springer and Rev. Mr. Jackson (the Legislative member
who had delivered the oration on the 4th), entered. Mr.
Jackson was much excited, and walked up and down the
room, interlarding questions and ejaculations and prayers
quite promiscuously; unheeding the kindly solicitude of a
bright little boy of five years, with shining auburn ringlets,
and great, soft, spiritual eyes, which looked eagerly towards
“the Elder’s” face as he went tugging a large Bible back
and forth behind him.</p>

<p>“Ha! Jackson, hear that boy now,” said Doc. “The
child is the best Christian of the two, come to the pinch.”</p>

<p>“What? What was you saying Doc?” asked the Reverend
Honorable.</p>

<p>“Why, just see what that boy has got, and hear what
he’s saying. <i>He</i> don’t scare worth a cent. Do you Bub?
You’ll make a soldier some day, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“No sir, I reckon I won’t, cause soldiers kill. ‘Thou
shalt not kill.’ That’s the sixth commandment.”</p>

<p>“What about the book, sonny,” asked Elder Jackson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“My Sunday school teacher says when I’m afraid, I
must ask God what to do; and this is His letter, He wrote
it. It’s big,” tugging to raise it to the level of the man’s
hand.</p>

<p>The Elder took the Bible, sat down, drew the child to
his side, opened it at random, and read, Isaiah xviii: 7:
“In that time shall the present be brought unto the Lord of
hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people
terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out
and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled,
to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, the Mount
Zion.”</p>

<p>He closed the book muttering, “Yes, the freshet came
clear up to the church, clear up to the church.”</p>

<p>“The whole matter is that the Bakers are determined to
break up this drilling,” said Marmor. “You’re too good a
drill master, Doc. The old man himself told me that it was
wrong, and that the niggers shouldn’t have no militia company,
and that it was wrong for you to drill by moonlight.
I told him that the white militia over here in Georgia
drilled on the streets every night. ‘Well, it’s wrong for the
niggers to drill at <i>all</i>,’ says he.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, it does ’pear to me like the white folks is determined
to put the devil into the colored people’s heads
anyhow. Now, we’re honest in this matter, and only want
to have a nice militia company like the white folks does,
and like free citizens has got a right to, and to protect the
State when it needs it and the Governor calls for us; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
they just goes to work, and by talking about what they
pretend the colored people is a going, or <i>intending</i> to do,
they just makes the colored people mad, and puts these bad
ideas into their heads, and by-and-by the colored people,
maybe will get courage enough to undertake to do as they
is really instructing us to do. And then there’s more’n
that in it too. Mor’n two months ago Hanson Baker tole me
and John Peters, Press Wells, and John Bade, and if I mistake
not, Lem Panesly, that the Democrats had made it up
in their own minds, and they had gone over the State, and
also had about thirty men from Texas and Mississippi to
come into this State, and they were feeding them, and organizing
all the white men into certain different clubs; and
before election that there had to be a certain number of
negroes killed&mdash;leading men; and if after that they found
out they couldn’t carry the State that way, they was
gwoine to kill enough so that they could carry the majority.
He said it is a fact that that has to be done, and he
said in the presence of these men, that it had to start right
here in Baconsville. He said Baconsville is the leading
place in the county (for the niggers, you know), and if
they could be successful in killing them that they wanted
to in Baconsville, they could carry the county; but the
same has to be done in all the counties, that there was no
way to prevent it. I told him we had some laws, and a
Governor and a President. He says he didn’t belong to
none o’ the clubs, and hadn’t nothing to do with it, but it
would be done, shor. I says, ‘Suppose the colored men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
have a poll to themselves, and the white men to themselves,’
and he said, ‘It don’t make a bit o’ difference what
sort o’ polls they have; it is the voting we want to stop;
and these voting niggers has got to be killed. The white
men has declared that the State has got to be ruled by
white men again, and we have got to have just such a government
as we had before the war; and when we git it, all
the poor men and the niggers has got to be disfranchised,
and the rich men will rule! And he tole me then that our
town marshal, John Carr and Dan will certainly be killed.
I asked why? and he said there was plenty of men that
had plenty against them, and they would kill them <i>shor</i>.
Says I, ‘Mr. Baker will I be in that number?’ he says,
‘No, I don’t know whether yo’r name is down or no, but it
depends on how yo’ behave yo’self.’ He’d been drinking
some, or he wouldn’t ha’ been so free to tell. Well, then I
received a note the other day&mdash;a letter with my name, and
specifying a dozen or more in this neighborhood that have
to be killed; and <i>I was shor</i> to be killed. Now, this is the
beginning of it shor. They want to disband this company
so that the Governor won’t have nothing to call on to put
them down, and we can’t get no protection till the United
States can send soldiers from somewhere, after we can get
word to the Governor, and he can git it to Grant. They
must think we’re just cowards and fools if we’ll let ’em
break us up, though I’ll agree that the men ha’n’t got much
fight in ’em, but I have, and I wish <i>they</i> had,” and Captain
Doc tossed a newspaper to the extreme end of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Scattered and peeled!” “Scattered and peeled!” said
the Elder, as he resumed his striding about the apartment.</p>

<p>While these excited men thus conversed, there were
borne from the street to their ears the sound of blood-curdling
oaths, and shouts of “We’ll carry the State about the
time we’ve killed four or five hundred of these niggers
and their carpet-bag cronies.” We’ve got to have South
Carolina.” “The white men have got to rule.” “This shall
be a white man’s government again.”</p>

<p>“Just hear that chap singing,” said Marmor with a ghastly
smile:</p>

<p>“We’re going to redeem South Carolina to-day. This
is the beginning of the redemption of my Caroline.” The
poor, maudlin fellow sat upon his horse near the corner of
the street hard by, and improvised a lengthy political
madrigal evidently to his own exquisite delight.</p>

<p>“I reckon you’ve got the right of it Doc,” said Marmor;
“the political side of this fuss swallows up all the rest.
The fuss on the Fourth, was only got up for making a spot
to strike at.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Doe, both goes together; for all the politics
they know is to put the niggers down, and themselves up
atop; and they are trying to fool the ignorant ones into
believing that the constitutions has all run out, so they
won’t try to take the law on ’em.”</p>

<p>“They’d better look out, or they may feel the law
themselves. If Chamberlain can’t enforce it, there is a
United States, they’ll find!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“I reckon so! I reckon so!” chimed in all present.</p>

<p>“Capt. Doc,” said Elder Jackson, “you must remember
that it is not your own life and your company’s lives that
is in danger, but that of every colored individual in town; and
the happiness and prosperity of all will be at their mercy
if a fight takes place; and so I beg you to come to terms
with Baker. Bend and apologize a little for the sake of
them that had nothing to do with the Fourth of July difficulty.”</p>

<p>“What can <i>I</i> do? Just tell me. I haven’t failed to think
of that, I tell you. That part of it is the biggest trouble
to me now.”</p>

<p>“It is Watta that has offended them the most,” said
Springer; “for he got so mad last Thursday. He’s got too
much white blood in him to stand their abuse, and he was
nigh about as abusive as Hanson Baker himself, that day.</p>

<p>It was all true enough what he said, but that didn’t
make it no better for them to take.”</p>

<p>“Now, Brother Watta, just you go, as you know you
ought to, and acknowledge you ought to have kept your
temper, and that’ll make the whole thing right, and Doc’ll
apologize too,” said the apparently confiding Elder.</p>

<p>“Do you think so? Well, suppose you come along with
us,” said Watta, a slight veil of credulity scarcely concealing
a sarcasm that bordered upon contempt for the
self-loving simplicity of the Elder. “I’d rather get on my
knees to them,” he added more seriously, “bad as I hate
them, than have my wife and children as scared as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
are to-day. But I doubt the success of even that, unless I
would give them my gun, and promise to lie there, and let
them kick me when they chose, or shoot me if they like,
and I’m afraid my <i>temper</i> would rise <i>then</i>, if I didn’t.”</p>

<p>In defiance of fears, the men all laughed at the ludicrous
picture of this tall, genteel-appearing, light yellow <i>gentleman</i>,
brimful of the same “spirit” that fired some of the
noblest heroes the South ever boasted of, and in whose
veins coursed much of the same ancestral blood, cringing
in such a pusillanimous fashion.</p>

<p>“It is no time for fun,” said Springer. “Will you go
with <i>me</i>, Adam Watta, and see General Baker?”</p>

<p>“If you say you think it’ll do any good, I will go.”</p>

<p>“You can but perish if you go,” said Elder Jackson,
who was, like many another, very courageous for his neighbors,
and quite willing to bid them Godspeed in any efforts
for the safety of the town, including Elder J. and his possessions.</p>

<p>But the men paused in the doorway. “Ask a man to
run the gauntlet of all those armed and half-drunken enemies?
I tell you I can’t do it; I’m not prepared to die, and
I sha’n’t go. I could <i>fight</i>, but to go right into a crowd to
be <i>murdered</i>, I’m not ready,” and Watta turned back.
Looking out upon the constantly increasing mob, Springer
did not urge him.</p>

<p>“I’m going to Prince Rives’s house,” said Doc, and strode
out of the office and down the street.</p>

<p>The cry of an infant was heard in an adjoining room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
followed by the sound of a rocking cradle, and the voice
of the little boy singing in chanting style, “You must not
cry, little sister; for the wicked men is all agoing around
to kill all the little children, ‘from two years old and under,’
and they will shoot your papa, and make your mamma
cry. So take this rattle and be still.”</p>

<p>“Louie,” called Marmor, from the office. “Don’t say
such things. Nobody’ll hurt you, nor the baby. Where
is your mamma?”</p>

<p>“She is here crying&mdash;sitting right here crying.”</p>

<p>“The man arose quickly, and entered the room. “Why,
Jane,” said he, “what are you crying about? It will be
all settled, and there’ll be no fuss.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you wish you could make me believe that, when
you know you don’t believe it yourself? I do wish you
would go away over to the city, and take the train somewhere.
I know they will be after you. You know they
want you killed, because you are a radical leader; and now
will be their time.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose I would go and leave you and the
children?”</p>

<p>“You know you couldn’t defend us, and we don’t need
it. We’re a great deal safer without you than with you.
I should fret all the time for fear that you had fallen into
their hands, to be sure; but I <i>know</i> there is no chance for
you to escape death if you stay here.”</p>

<p>Marmor returned to his office, and found that his friends
had all left. He saw them approaching Rives’s house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
There they found Captain Doc and the Trial Justice in
earnest conversation.</p>

<p>“I can’t appear before your court, Judge Rives&mdash;not to-day,”
said the captain; “for I feel that your court is unable
to protect my life, and I believe my life is unsafe. I
am willing that yo’ should go to work and draw up a bond,
that yo’ think proper, and I am willing to give bonds to a
higher court, where I think my life will be safe. The reason
I come to yo’ to tell yo’, is because I don’t want yo’ to
suppose that I treat yo’r court with no disrespect by not
coming; but it is because I don’t think my life is safe.”</p>

<p>The Justice reflected.</p>

<p>“Well, you must use your own judgment,” said he. “Of
course, if your life is unsafe, and if these men intend to
take your life, of course, I can’t protect you. I haven’t
protection enough to protect you; my constables can’t do
much!”</p>

<p>“That is my belief,” replied Doc, “and for that reason
I don’t want to go befo’ yo’r court without yo’ force me
to; and then if I am killed, yo’ will be responsible.”</p>

<p>“You can use your own judgment, Captain. I shall go
to court at the proper time. Your name, of course, will
be called, and if you don’t answer to your name&mdash;well, <i>you
won’t be there to answer</i>. It’s a pity but this thing couldn’t
be settled without going to court. I’m afraid once at the
court room it will be impossible to get along without
trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I want it settled,” said Doc. “And I,” “And I,”
said the two Lieutenants.</p>

<p>“Well, then, suppose I go for you, and ask what will
give satisfaction,” said Springer.</p>

<p>“All right,” was the ready response from all.</p>

<p>Mr. Springer met Judge Kanrasp coming down the
street, from his interview with the General, and each communicated
the message he bore, and thought the best thing
for the safety of the town, was to get the parties together
with the crowd excluded.</p>

<p>“Who is to take the guns?” asked Mr. Springer.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. The Governor, I suppose. If not, that
may alter the case.”</p>

<p>“If Gen. Baker will guarantee the safety of the men, I
believe they will be safe, but he should guarantee the
safety of the town also.”</p>

<p>“So say I,” replied Judge Kanrasp, and each passed on
his errand.</p>

<p>Judge K. reported to the officers only Gen. Baker’s
request for an interview, and withheld his proposition for
a settlement.</p>

<p>Soon Mr. Springer returned with the same request from
the General. They all approached the door, and Doc went
out upon the street, but re-entered immediately.</p>

<p>“There is no one more readier than I am to settle, but I
see a great crowd down there at Dunn’s store, all armed,
and drunk, or playing off drunk. Springer, yo’ tell Gen. Baker
that I would meet him, but that I would like for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
him to come away from where them men are, and that I am
willing to meet him at yo’r house, if that is agreeable.”</p>

<p>The aspect of things became more gloomy very soon.
A company of twenty-five or thirty thoroughly-armed
and mounted men had entered the village some time before,
since which squads had been seen coming in from all
directions.</p>

<p>Several leading citizens had joined the group at Rives’s
house, and all united in urging the officers to comply with
Gen. Baker’s request; but they were more and more reluctant
to go, fearing it was only a ruse to decoy them there,
secure, disarm, and then murder them.</p>

<p>The suspicion was but natural, as similar transactions
had been far from rare since reconstruction. At length,
after it had been reported that Gen. Baker had sworn to
lay the town in ashes if they did not comply with his demands,
all the members of the company again consented
to go, but on approaching the door, fell back again.</p>

<p>“You must go to save the town,” said Springer; “but
don’t take your guns.”</p>

<p>“We won’t go without them,” said all the men.</p>

<p>“But he’ll make a demand for their surrender. Better
leave them behind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is just it,” said Watta. “You men have been
keeping that back. Why should we go to General Baker?
Why doesn’t he come to us if he wants to see us? There
are no drunken rowdies here for him to fear. Two men
drove into our ranks, an organized a legally chartered company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of the State militia, with loyal guns in our loyal
hands, and a flag which brought us freedom from these old
masters&mdash;the right to stand up like men, and not fear their
nigger-catching blood-hounds; and we have sworn to be
true to that flag&mdash;to the United States, and to the State,
and ourselves, and to take care of these guns that belong
to the State, and to yield them up only to lawful authority.
These two nigger-catchers whose occupation is gone, drove
into our ranks; and we, like a set of cowards, opened ranks
and let them go through; and now they bring this ex-confederate
General, who got the only title he has and of
which he and they are so proud, in fighting the United
States; they bring this General Baker here, and he asks us
to go down to old Baker’s feet and apologize&mdash;for what?
<i>I</i> don’t know; and to give up our guns that we have
sworn to protect from all enemies of the Union, and all
unauthorized persons&mdash;to give them to this ex-confederate
General, who boasts to-day, and is applauded by these, his
old confederate soldiers around him to-day, for what he
did against the Government. <i>He</i>, surrounded by those who
love and revere him for what he did to destroy the Union
and keep us and our parents and children in slavery&mdash;he demands
our guns and ourselves! Pretty <i>National Guards</i>!!
Which are we, men, cowards or traitors?”</p>

<p>“Don’t take your guns, and may be possible you can get
along without giving the guns up. I surely don’t want
you to be traitors,” said the Elder; “but I trust an apology
will do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“And I trust no such thing,” said Doc. “And where
shall we be after this, living or dead? It won’t make much
difference. They want to break us up! that’s it&mdash;and enslave
us!”</p>

<p>“Where shall we be? On our knees forever at their
feet,” replied Watta; “that is, if a single man of us ever
got away alive, which I’ll warrant we never should if we
refused to give up our guns.”</p>

<p>“But remember, there’ll be bloodshed if you don’t go,”
said Elder Jackson. “Better humble yourselves than be
killed.”</p>

<p>“And remember, too, the women and children, and the
property,” added Springer.</p>

<p>“You men is mighty thoughtful; suppose yo’ ’go yo’selves.
’Twouldn’t be no blood shed if <i>they</i> got killed, I
reckon yo’ think,” said a man from the ranks.</p>

<p>They had retired to an upper room, and Kanrasp approached
a window looking towards Dunn’s store. Doc
followed, and then Watta, and then others.</p>

<p>Still more armed men were seen coming into the town,
and the mob around the General’s headquarters was more
dense and disorderly.</p>

<p>“You all know that it would be only my dead body that
would ever leave that place, if I went there,” said Watta.
“I should be riddled with bullets in no time. Those men
standing outside of that groggery are thirsting for my
blood this minute.”</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have known Gen. Baker for several years, and I believe
he is an honorable man, and he will protect you,”
said Judge K&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>“An honorable man?” repeated Watta. “‘An honorable
man’ he may be when dealing with those he acknowledges
his equals, if there are any such; but I am ‘only a nigger’
(baring his yellow arm to his elbow.) “Honor? He’ll
ventilate no honor when a nigger or politics is concerned.
I don’t mean any disrespect to you, Judge; but Gen. Baker
doesn’t hold the same views about colored people that you
do, as you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going,” said the First Lieutenant, “and I
talked as bad as any of you on the Fourth. I’ll apologize.”</p>

<p>“But they hate me more than all the rest of you,” resumed
Watta, still inspecting his bare arm. “I’m nearer
their color, and the best thing they can say of a man of my
complexion is that he’s a smart fellow, but needs watching.
And they do watch us, and they magnify everything we
do or say, and misconstrue it, and lie about us. And then
you know I’m that heinous offender&mdash;a ‘nigger school
teacher, and a Republican newspaper correspondent.’ Why,
Gen. Baker <i>can’t protect me</i>. I should be shot a dozen
times before he knew I was coming. And then he’d regret
it. That wouldn’t do me much good, nor my family. I
tell you it is only a trap, a decoy, to get us up there and
massacre us. If they kill me, they must come after me,
I a’n’t fool enough to go to them to get shot.”</p>

<p>“If the General could get shet of them armed men, would
you go?” asked Springer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, certainly.”</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll try if he will go to my house,” and he slipped
cautiously out of the dwelling, for the whites thought the
officers were in the Armory, and he did not wish to undeceive
them.</p>

<p>He was successful on his mission, and soon returned; but
the officers had seen the shouting throng surround and follow
their General, and as the streets were rife with warlike
menaces, <i>all</i> now utterly refused to go to a house so near
Dunn’s store and the main crowd.</p>

<p>“See! see!” they exclaimed. “They are coming down
the street to meet us! Gen. Baker can’t protect us!” All
of which Springer could not dispute, so he sadly returned
to Gen. Baker, who, on his approaching, called out:</p>

<p>“I suppose you couldn’t get those fellows to meet
me?”</p>

<p>“No, General, they are too afraid of these armed bodies
of men you have around you. That is the only reason.”</p>

<p>“Armed men? armed men? I don’t see any armed men!”
and that military dignitary rolled his eyes about as if in
pantomime. “Well Sam, there’s no use parleying any longer.
Now, by &mdash;&mdash; I want those guns, and I’ll be &mdash;&mdash; if I don’t
have them!”</p>

<p>A movement of expectancy swayed the throng as these
words were heard and passed from lip to lip, and then a
shout rent the air.</p>

<p>Mr. Springer wended his way back through the crowd of
men on horseback, and men on foot, whose fingers fidgeted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
upon the triggers of their firearms, and he sought the
house of Justice Rives with a heavier heart than he had
ever borne before; while General Baker entered his carriage
again, as the hour for court drew near.</p>

<span class="wn">PORTENTIOUS DARKNESS.</span></h2>

<p class="pp12q p1">“Ye gods, it doth amaze me!</p>
<p class="pp10">A man of such feeble temper should<br />
So get the start of the majestic world.”</p>
<p class="pr4">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Casca.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">A small</span>, dark man, with a lithe form and sparkling eyes,
had been busy preparing Justice Rives’s office for the expected
court, as he had been previously directed, and was
unaware of the excitement prevailing in other parts of the
village. His task completed, he seated himself in an armchair,
adjusted his feet high upon the post of the open
door, and with his coat off and fan in hand, sat leisurely
reading.</p>

<p>About half past three o’clock he was startled by an imperative
voice, asking, “Where is Rives?”</p>

<p>On looking up from his newspaper, he saw Robert Baker
and his legal counsel seated in the latter’s carriage, which
stood before the door.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rives is at his house, I reckon; but he’ll be here
directly,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Go and tell him to come here to me,” commanded the
General.</p>

<p>“I’m not Mr. Rives’s office-boy. I am a constable, and am
here attending to my business. He told me he would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
here by four o’clock, and he won’t come any quicker by
my going after him.”</p>

<p>General B.&mdash;“Do you know who you are talking to?”</p>

<p>Constable Newton.&mdash;“I’m talking to General Baker, I
believe.”</p>

<p>Gen. B.&mdash;“Well, you scamp! bring me some paper
here.”</p>

<p>Newton.&mdash;“Here is the office, and here is the chairs, and
here is the paper, and pen and ink, sir; and here is the
chairs for all the attorneys that wants to do business here
to come in and sit down.”</p>

<p>Gen. B. (with an oath).&mdash;“Bring it to me, sir!”</p>

<p>Newton.&mdash;“I won’t do it. Come in, sir, and sit at the
table.”</p>

<p>The irate General sprang from his carriage, and, followed
by the ever-ready Gaston, rushed into the court room in a
menacing manner. But the imperturbable constable did not
move, nor show signs of disturbance.</p>

<p>Gen. B. (with a vile epithet and oaths, which the reader
should imagine, thickly strewn throughout this colloquy).&mdash;“Give
me that chair!”</p>

<p>Newton.&mdash;“There is a chair.”</p>

<p>General B. thundered.&mdash;“<i>Give me that chair you are
sitting on!</i> Get out of that chair, and give it to me! I
want this chair and intend to have it!”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Newton, after a pause; “if this
chair suits you better than the others, take it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Gen. B.&mdash;“You &mdash;&mdash; leatherhead radical! You sitting
down there fanning yourself!”</p>

<p>Newton.&mdash;“I am fanning myself, sitting in my own
office, and attending to my own business.”</p>

<p>Gen. B.&mdash;“You vile brute, you! You want to have a
bullet-hole put through you before you can move!”</p>

<p>At this juncture old man Baker and one of his followers,
pistols in hand, reinforced the General, and Tommy rode
as close to the door as possible, with his trusty carbine,
while others appeared outside.</p>

<p>Newton arose, and taking his chair by the back, turned
the seat of it toward General Baker, and, still holding the
back with both hands, said:</p>

<p>“There it is, Gen. Baker, if you want it; and you can
shoot me, if you want to. Mr. Robert Baker, you know
what sort of a man I am. I have always tried to behave
myself when you came in the office.”</p>

<p>Robert B.&mdash;“Yes, but” (with an oath) “this drilling has
got to stop. I want you to go for Rives.”</p>

<p>Newton.&mdash;“I’ve got no right to go for Rives, and I’m
not going.”</p>

<p>Robert B.&mdash;“Well you’ll be a dead man, and you’ll
wish you had gone.”</p>

<p>Newton.&mdash;“I am but one man.”</p>

<p>Gen. B. (with oaths and sneers of contempt).&mdash;“Sitting
down there with your feet cocked up!”</p>

<p>Newton.&mdash;“Well, General, I’m not dead; but if you’re
going to kill me, why kill me; and that is all you can do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Gen. B.&mdash;“We’ll take our time about that. We’ll show
you, you insolent darkie!&mdash;you contemptible nigger!”</p>

<p>The Bakers returned to their carriages in high dudgeon.</p>

<p>“There is Justice Rives’ private secretary,” said the old
man, as they were about leaving the premises. “If you
will speak to him, I think he will go for Rives.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the incensed General, “I am not going to
be insulted again. You can do so if you choose.”</p>

<p>Robert Baker did choose, for he preferred to reserve resentment,
rather than allow it to thwart or hinder his
purposes. Gaston, however, ‘halted’ the secretary, and
undertook the mission himself.</p>

<p>Can the reader imagine the scene in that upper room in
Rives’ house, when a female servant announced that Gaston
was at the door below, urging the presence of Judge
Rives at the court-room, as Gen. Baker and his clients
were waiting there; though the hour had not yet arrived?</p>

<p>Noiselessly the entire group descended to the ground
floor, and, screened from view, listened breathlessly to the
collocution which, however, was brief and courteous, as
the young man naturally wished to conciliate the favor of
the Judge. He was dismissed with the assurance that the
court should be opened promptly.</p>

<p>Prince Rives (the Judge’s baptismal name was Prince&mdash;it
might seem sacrilege to designate a name given in
slavery as “Christian”) stepped quietly into his sitting-room&mdash;a
perfect bower of flowers, ferns growing under
glass, and singing-birds, where his wife and eldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
daughter were anxiously watching the crowd gathering in
the streets.</p>

<p>“I’m going down to the office now,” said he, “and if
any trouble should occur, stay right here in the house, and
keep the children in, and you will all be safe.”</p>

<p>Alas! these were assurances false even to the heart of
him who made them.</p>

<p>Has the reader ever laid a kiss upon a loved one’s brow,
and then watched the dear form passing beyond recall,
perhaps, (oh, that terrible <i>perhaps</i>!) if returning at all, to
come a lifeless thing&mdash;an uninhabited tenement&mdash;or in
agony and blood; while the ever active imagination
chafed and chid the hands and feet that fain would do its
bidding and follow that loved form, though duty fettered
them to inactivity?</p>

<p>Or has he gone out under the benediction of love, to
meet a hate that might hold him in its deadly grasp, forbidding
his return?</p>

<p>To such we need not describe the adieus exchanged in
that little sitting-room; for the sweet influences of love
take no cognizance of complexion.</p>

<p>Trial Justice Prince Rives soon issued from the front
door of his house, book in hand, erect and commanding,
looking the true ideal African General as he was, and
walked leisurely up the street, unattended, and apparently
unarmed; as if to show the mob that at least one negro
was not afraid.</p>

<p>Tall, straight, powerful, his black and shining visage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
perfectly calm, he strode through the throng of armed and
angry men that surrounded the door of his office, and
crowded the court-room.</p>

<p>Kanrasp and Springer followed at some distance to witness
should any disturbance arise; and while attention was
thus attracted towards the court-room, the officers all made
their way to the armory, whither many other members of
the Company and other citizens had already hastened for
safety behind its strong walls, doors and window-shutters.
Women and children fled across the long bridge to the
city, or to the surrounding country; though many remained
to guard their small possessions, and share the fate of husbands
and fathers, should the worst come.</p>

<p>Armed men were still coming in, and yet more rapidly,
and the sinking sun heralded a brief, southern twilight and
a moonless night; while a great terror took possession of
the inhabitants of the doomed village.</p>

<p>A few straggling members of the Company appearing
with their guns, which they had formerly taken to their
homes for cleaning, became the unfortunate subjects of a
hue and cry as they hurried along towards the rendezvous,
and were marked for the night’s barbarities.</p>

<p>No small exhibition of nerve was now required of that
African Major-General of the obnoxious “National
Guards,”&mdash;one of the very men whose high military position
was so offensive to the white men now surrounding
him, and thronging his court-room, that, though notably
fond of the practice of arms, they utterly disregarded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
law requiring their enrollment as State Militia-men, lest
they might be subordinated to him.</p>

<p>Yet with measured step and dignified mien he passed the
carriage where the Bakers still sat, greeting them with easy
politeness.</p>

<p>“I should like to know whether you are sitting in the
capacity of Major-General of State Militia, or as a Trial
Justice?” said Gen. Baker, when all was in readiness.</p>

<p>“That will depend upon the nature of the testimony. I
am sitting as a peace officer; and if the facts are such as
to justify my sitting as a Trial Justice, I will do so; if
not, it will be otherwise.”</p>

<p>“It is immaterial to me; I merely wanted to know. I
want to investigate the facts of this matter, and either
capacity will be agreeable to me,” replied the General.</p>

<p>At this juncture the Intendant (Mayor), approached, and
whispered to the General, “I think if you would suspend
this trial for awhile, we could settle it.”</p>

<p>“Just ask the Judge. If he suspends I am willing.”</p>

<p>A brief conference ensued, after which the Judge announced
a suspension for ten minutes.</p>

<p>This caused dissatisfaction among the spectators, as a
peaceful adjustment would be but a tame issue of all their
military preparations.</p>

<p>Intendant Garndon then conducted the plaintiffs and
their attorney to the council chamber, which was separated
from Dunn’s shop on the corner or Main Street by only
one half the width of a narrow street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time the largest and most unruly part of the cavalry
was gathered about this corner groggery, and a less
suitable place for the conference could not have been
selected; but each would-be peacemaker seemed to think
peace most attainable on his own premises.</p>

<p>Though the distance was less than four squares, as they
could proceed but slowly through the throng, it sufficed
Gen. Baker to administer a lecture to the dusky official
upon his personal culpability in having allowed “this so-called
militia company,” to train “upon Mr. Robert Baker’s
road,” and with arms in their hands&mdash;though, doubtless
the poor, berated mayor found difficulty in understanding
how a public highway could be “Mr. Robert Baker’s
road,” or how he could have disarmed the State’s militia.</p>

<p>As has already been stated, quite a number of colored
citizens, and of the rank and file of the militia men, had
gathered in and about the armory, hoping to find protection
there.</p>

<p>Among them was Dan Pipsie, who was quite sober, and
his own plucky self.</p>

<p>“Well, if I war Captain Doc, I’d do anyt’ing on earth to
settle dis myself,” said Dan. “I wouldn’t have de blood
of all dese collo’d families on <i>my</i> head. When I die, I
don’t want no man’s wife cussin’ me, noh blamin’ me fo’
his death.”</p>

<p>“Capt. Doc a’n’t a bit to blame now,” replied Mann
Harris. “I was ’bout two hundred yards from ’em at the
time of the fuss. I saw Gaston and Tom Baker drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
down, and get out and go into Nunberger’s store. I saw
the company coming back, an’ they was a gwoine up then,
and they met and talked awhile, an’ the company divided
an’ let them go through. Let’s go down, an’ see Rives
about this, Ned O’Bran, an’ git him to send a dispatch to
the Governor to help us.”</p>

<p>“Well, come on,” replied Ned.</p>

<p>They entered the quiet office of the Justice, and found
him sitting there alone, and looking over books and
papers.</p>

<p>“General, what <i>is</i> you doing?” asked Harris, with emphasis.</p>

<p>“I am waiting for people to come into court again.”</p>

<p>“If you wait here awhile longer, they’ll make you jump
out o’ here entirely!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s about four hundred men out there with
guns and pistols.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I’ll go out and see&mdash;Well, really, this is surprising!
What is all this about?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the excited Harris. “They’re gwoine
to take the guns away from the armory.”</p>

<p>The three men walked up the street conversing. Meanwhile
Captain Doc entered his own apartments, which it
will be remembered, were in the same building as the armory
or drill room.</p>

<p>“I’ve been in my shirt sleeves,” said he to his wife, “ever
since I left my bench at noon; but, (with a grim smile,) if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
I’m gwoine to see such big men as General Baker or the
Laud, I reckon I’d best put my coat on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Doc, don’t talk so ’bout de Laud! I’m awful scarred
to have yo’ go.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a right to go. They say General Baker’s gone
up to the Council Chamber, and he and Garndon’ll be expecting
us.”</p>

<p>“I’m awful scarred fo’ yo’, an’ I’m a mind to go ’way
myself. ’Spex they’ll be shootin’ ’round yere so the baby
couldn’t sleep no how. Mann Harris, he’s taken his wife off,
’bout an hour by sun, or so, poor soul! sick as she’s been,
now mighty nigh on to a year. Mann tole me he’d positive
his word thar’ would be no fuss nor killin’; but I’d positive
my word he war’ ’feared, else he wouldn’t come totin’ Dinah
down all dem stairs, an hauled ’er off up to Miss Pipton’s;
fo’ it’s mighty nigh on to fo’ mile ovah da; and Dinah
has determined to me that it hurt her tolerable bad to
stir at all.”</p>

<p>The Captain had been looking out of the window while
she spoke, towards Dunn’s store and the Council Chambers,
Turning abruptly, he asked&mdash;</p>

<p>“Where is the baby?”</p>

<p>“I done toted ’er ovah to Elder Jackson’s but I can’t let
’er stay dar. I’ll jes lock up de house, an’ git de baby, an’
clar out ovah de rivah, fo’ de scar o’ stayin’ in dis yere
house’ll perish me out, if I’m de onus one fo’ a quarter
hour mo’.”</p>

<p>“Now, Debby, yo’ get the baby, and take ’er over to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Rives’s, and stay thar, he’s been so conciliating to ’em,
and they think a heap o’ him. Blamed but I wish the
baby was here a minute till I kiss ’er ’fo’ I go up to see
General Baker. Don’t get scared now. They won’t hurt
the women, I reckon. It’s only them as votes an’ can manage
a gun they’re after. Take care yo’rself,” and he kissed
her.</p>

<p>“Oh, ain’t yo’ scarred to go, Doc?” sobbed she, clinging to
him. “I spex yo’re forced to by persuasion; but I’m feared
they’ll put a bullet into yo’, and maybe fifty.” Here she
broke down entirely, and wept aloud, sobbing, “Oh, don’t
go, Doc! don’t go!”</p>

<p>“But I’ve got a right to, to save the town. He’ll lay it
in ashes. I wouldn’t like to tell yo, all the way they’re
talking, and making big threats, and abusing us to everything
yo’ can think.”</p>

<p>“To my knowance they’re mighty bad; and I’m mighty
glad Mann Harris sent his wife off.”</p>

<p>“Well, Debby, yo’ go and get the baby, and take good
care of her. I reckon you’d best tote her ovah to your mother’s
’cross the river. Some on ’em might hurt her if they
knowed she was mine.”</p>

<p>They left the house together, and Doc locked the door,
and put the key in his pocket.</p>

<p>“Oh, my lawses!” exclaimed Mrs. Doc. “Don’t yo’ go
up thar, Doc! Jes see such heaps o’ men! Jes lots and piles
of ’em! <i>Now yo’ sha’n’t go!</i>”</p>

<p>“No mo’ I won’t! They picks out all the hardest places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
for a man to go to; but his soldiers ’d follow the General
anywhere. There he is now. <i>He</i> ain’t gwoine to meet <i>me</i>.
See! He knows I’m here well enough, but he won’t look at
me. Ah! He’s gwoine over to the city. P’raps he’ll just
clar out, now he’s got the rest agoing. There’s Kanrasp,
and Rives too.”</p>

<p>General Rives and his two neighbors met General Baker
at the next corner. The latter was on horseback and rode
up to General Rives and demanded the name of the Colonel
of the Eighteenth Regiment.</p>

<p>“Colonel Williams,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“At his house, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“I want him. I want those guns, and by&mdash;&mdash;I’ve got to
have them.”</p>

<p>“General Baker, I don’t know what to do about them.
I’ll go up and see the Captain, and consult with him, and
see if he says to give them up.”</p>

<p>A moment later and he met Judge Kanrasp, who was
earnestly urging the colored men, women, and children
who were huddled in knots upon the street, to go home and
remain quietly in their houses.</p>

<p>“Kanrasp,” said Judge Rives, “It is no use for you to
stay here and get killed; and you will be killed if you
stay,&mdash;a ‘carpet-bagger and a radical,’ like you.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” added Marmor, and Doc, and Watta, who now
joined the group; and they hastily accompanied him down
to the Rail Road platform nearly opposite the armory, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
urged him to flee, as one who would be first attacked. Rapidly
crossing the river, upon the Rail Road bridge, the
train, which arrived, in ten minutes took him homewards;
too soon for the accomplishment of his purpose to learn Gen.
Baker’s mission to the city.</p>

<p>Never were the combative characteristics of the whites
and colored races in the Southern States more clearly exhibited
than in the scenes at Baconsville that day, though
leading colored men, whose exceptional energy, and perhaps
assertion, had made them such, were necessarily
prominent. Not bravery, so much as skill in its exercise,
constitutes the white man a leader among his fellows.</p>

<p>In general terms it may be said that timidity, with extremely
rare acts of rashness, characterizes the colored race,
bravado and arbitrary assumption, of the white and both are
the victims of mutual suspicion and distrust, which often
<i>cause</i> the dreaded ill.</p>

<p>Gen. Baker was absent half an hour, and on his return a
general remounting took place, while over the hill at the
back of the village, came a large company of horsemen, all
well armed.</p>

<p>Down Main street they rode, two abreast, and were at
once distributed throughout the town; a squad upon each
street corner, attended by an equal number of infantry; all
with weapons in hand ready for immediate action.</p>

<p>Look which way they would, the distracted freedmen
saw armed men, and re-enforcements constantly arriving
from all directions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Darkness was approaching, and though the hills around
were still touched by the glow of the setting sun, its refracted
rays seemed to exaggerate the squalor, and magnify
the deformities of the little town in the valley; and, exalting
the warlike preparations, to clothe them with every
imaginable horror; while the humidity of the evening air
intensified the sounds of blood-thirsty riot.</p>

<p>Justice Marmor now closed and locked his office door,
and began at this tardy moment, to think of adopting Mrs.
M’s advice.</p>

<p>Stepping out of his own back door, he leaped the fence
into his neighbor’s yard, and, mounting his doorsteps,
stood in a closely latticed corner of a porch, and took observations.</p>

<p>The square was surrounded by the Rifle-clubs,&mdash;the
remnants and second-growth of the cropped, but not uprooted
Confederate cavalry,&mdash;standing thick, two abreast,
with guns resting upon each left arm.</p>

<p>In the vernacular of the South, Marmor was “a <i>scallawag</i>,”
for, though once a brave Confederate soldier, he had
become a consistent advocate of the idea that the “all
men” who are “created free and equal” includes the colored
race; and probably no man in the devoted town stood in
greater danger than he.</p>

<p>“Co im ’s house, Meester Marmor:&mdash;&mdash;i’m ’s house
quick!” said Dan Lemfield, opening the back-door of his
dwelling. You be mine neighbor, and shall not be shot on
mine dreshold. Co hide self! Co!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Marmor did not decline the invitation, but stepped
quickly in, and passing to the parlor in front, peeped from
behind the window shades, which Mrs. Lemfield had drawn
closely down.</p>

<p>At the opposite corner of the street, his most implacable
enemy, the eldest son of Col. Baker, sat upon his horse,
with self-complacent manner waiting the appearance of his
prey, or the word of command from the great General.
He was supported by eight or ten other men, not less vigilant.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Marmor!” besought Mrs. Lemfield, “do go up
stairs, and keep out of sight. They have threatened about
you so much that some of them will surely come in here,
and kill you! Do go up, quick! quick!”</p>

<p>Marmor obeyed, and immediately the host, who had been
out, re-entered with wild eyes and white lips.</p>

<p>“Vo ish dat mon, Sarah?”</p>

<p>She signed with her hand, in reply; at the same time
saying, in an indifferent tone, “Oh, he’s gone up, he is not
here,” for their little child had entered, and she feared it
might betray their guest.</p>

<p>The excited Jew (for Lemfield was a Jew) leaped up the
stairs, calling out as he ran, “Don’t shoot! It’s me&mdash;jist
me. Oh, moine goot freund! Vat vill dese men to?
Shenneral Paker say he vill hab de guns, oder he vill pekin
to fire in von half hour. Colonel A. P., dat ole man you
seen sthrapping on dem pig bistols by’me Post Office, he
tole me close up mine par in’ leetle sthore. Vell, dey ish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
hab too much visky now; so I mind quick, I tell you!
He tole same ting yo’ mudda, an’ she pe shut up.”</p>

<p>“Where is she?” asked Marmor.</p>

<p>“My golly! Se ist plucky ole voman. Se im leetle
sthore&mdash;all ’lone by self. She not come avay.”</p>

<p>“Where are my wife and children?”</p>

<p>“Im house&mdash;your house. Dat ish pest blace. Nicht
wahr? Pest not pe mit you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Marmor, absently.</p>

<p>“Oh, ya! Mon come here, mon sag, ‘Meester dare
sure.’ Now co dis vay,” and he led the way to a loft; “Here
co om roof van dey get you. Hark! Vat dat noise down
stair ish?”</p>

<p>The next instant Mrs. Marmor rushed into the chamber
and threw her arms about her husband’s neck in a paroxysm
of weeping.</p>

<p>He folded her to his breast, and commanding a calm and
cheerful tone, said, “Jane, Jane, don’t give way so. Why,
I’m not afraid; I shall come off all right, and nobody will
hurt you or the children. Our people are chivalrous, and
won’t hurt a woman.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t know! you don’t know!” she sobbed.
“Capt. Baker just now told me, as I was coming to bid
you good-bye,” (here her sobs interrupted her speech) “he
told me,” she resumed, “if I wanted to save my children
from getting killed, to go into the house and lock the doors.
And so I must go and save my poor babies. Duck got
scared and ran off and left me all alone,” and she placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
her cold trembling hands on either side of her husband’s
face, and kissed him. Then pressing them upon her heart,
she descended the stairs, moaning aloud.</p>

<p>“Great heavens! Am I a <i>man</i>?” exclaimed Marmor,
“to let my wife go like that, and I hiding to save my own
life!” and he sprang to the stairs to follow her.</p>

<p>Quick as thought, the Jew placed himself before him,
and held him back.</p>

<p>“She be not cry for self; just for <i>you</i>. You co da, she
cry more. Man not touch her, noh leetle kinder. Yo’ co
hide now, quick!”</p>

<p>Five minutes later, the same Col. Baker, her husband’s
enemy, rapped loudly upon Mrs. Marmor’s door, with the
loaded handle of his riding-whip.</p>

<p>Almost too much frightened to stand, she opened the
door, and peeped out.</p>

<p>“You must take your children, and leave this house if
you do not want to be killed,” said the gallant Colonel.</p>

<p>“Oh, where shall I go? What shall I do?” cried the
distracted mother.</p>

<p>“You must get out of here, and that is all I can tell
you,” said he, with an oath. “No use to lock your door&mdash;leave
it open, I tell you, and go!”</p>

<p>Nearly all the colored people had, by this time, taken
the advice of Judge Kanrasp, or of their fears, and fled
the streets. Like timid conies, some sought the vain
shelter of their homes, others that of the neighboring
cornfields or river-banks and bridges, and still others fled
to the surrounding country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Doc, Watta and Sems went across the street after Kanrasp
left, taking about thirty or forty men with them to
the drill-room on the second floor.</p>

<p>About this time four colored men were seen to issue from
an humble dwelling, and, with heroic purpose as their only
visible weapon, they quietly made their way along the
fortified streets. They were frequently halted and their
business demanded, when their uniform reply was “To see
Gen. Baker;” and the moral sublimity of their position
seemed to impress even the conscienceless rioters, for only
verbal abuse was hurled at them.</p>

<p>Arm-in-arm walked Gen. Justice Rives and the Methodist
preacher&mdash;Elder Jackson&mdash;(visibly quaking within his
spotless linen, and coat of snowy whiteness). Behind this
worthy pair came Springer, the chief man of money and
of business in the town, with Lem Picksley, a well-known,
peaceable, and long-time resident; the best educated and
best-liked citizen.</p>

<p>At length they found the man they sought&mdash;armed,
mounted and surrounded by cavalry arranged in warlike
attitude, who appeared to reverence him as their chief.</p>

<p>“Gen. Baker,” said Rives, “we have come to ask if
there is <i>anything</i> we can do to make peace.”</p>

<p>“Nothing will satisfy me but the surrender of the men
and their guns.”</p>

<p>“We have no authority to surrender them, as you very
well know. The men are not criminals convicted, and you
have no warrant or authority of law; and the men say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
their oaths to the State forbid their surrendering the arms
to you. If you can show any authority for receiving
them, that you have more than any other private citizen,
they will give them up at once; but they say they cannot
otherwise, because, if they should voluntarily yield them
up to you or any other private citizen, especially surrounded
by such an armed body as this, without authority
of law&mdash;well, General, you’re a lawyer, and you know
what the law calls it. The law and their oath of office will
not allow them.”</p>

<p>“Rives,” replied this great chieftain, “you are the
Major General of the State Militia in this district, and
can demand them.”</p>

<p>“Not without cause, or order from my superior!”</p>

<p>“By &mdash;&mdash;!” said the negro-catcher, Baker, who stood
near, “you had better do something, for there’s going to
be &mdash;&mdash; to pay here, if those officers and guns are not delivered
up.”</p>

<p>“I want to see the Colonel of this regiment. I want
these officers and these guns,” said Gen. Baker with great
vehemence.</p>

<p>Ned O’Bran, who had joined the four peace-makers, now
slipped through the crowd and back to the armory.</p>

<p>“How does it look, Ned?” asked Lieut. Watta from a
window above his head.</p>

<p>“It looks squally. Now, Watta, you men just bar the
windows and doors, and let nothing nor nobody in the
world in there; and by this means they will have nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
nor nobody in the world to fight, if they want to fight, but
themselves. There’s bound to be a fuss; for I heard Gen.
Baker say myself, that what he intended to do this evening
won’t stop till after the seventh of next November, and
that is election day, you know. So shut yourselves up,
and keep still.”</p>

<p>Watta closed the window, and Ned returned to the place
of conference.</p>

<p>A horse pushed against Springer’s companion, and he
mildly laid his hand upon the animal’s shoulder and said,
addressing it, “Take care, sir!”</p>

<p>Quick as thought the rider’s whip cut a smart gash upon
the dusky cheek.</p>

<p>The chivalrous Gen. Baker, looking on, took out his own
pocket handkerchief, and wiped the perspiration from his
own face, while the unoffending mulatto wiped the blood
from his; and Springer’s unflinching eye arrested the hand
of another of the General’s aids, as he was about to send
a bullet through his (Springer’s) brain.</p>

<p>Neither the attack nor menace elicited rebuke nor notice
from the “high-toned” General, who disdainfully turned
and rode away.</p>

<p>“If we will box the guns up,” said Rives, following
him, “and return them to the Governor, will <i>that</i> be satisfactory?”</p>

<p>“&mdash;&mdash; the Governor! I am not here as the Governor
of South Carolina, nor his agent, but as General Baker!”</p>

<p>“Well, we are sorry if there is nothing we can do to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
make peace, General, but (turning to his companions) we
must return without it, and each do the best he can for
himself.”</p>

<p>“Here’s Ned O’Bran,” said Springer in an undertone,
“Brother Jackson, you had better go with him, for his
house is outside of the picket lines; and as you’re a member
of the Legislature, you must look out&mdash;they’ll be after
you shor.”</p>

<p>“I was just going down to the drill room to be safe
myself,” said O’Bran. “My family went on so that I am on
my way back to the armory.”</p>

<p>“You can’t get through this way. The pickets are
everywhere. You had best go home. It’s every man for
himself, and the Lord for us all,” said Springer, and the
men separated.</p>

<p class="pp6">Oh, my people! O my brothers! let us choose the righteous side.”</p>
<p class="pr4">&mdash;<span class="smcap">Whittier’s Voices of Freedom.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> sun was sinking in the west, when the sound of Aunt
Phoebe’s dinner-horn was heard, followed by Uncle
Jesse’s cheery response.</p>

<p>Auntie was the model-housekeeper of the neighborhood,
(not a high compliment, some readers might think, could
they see many of the homes there, where the women spend
most of their strength and time at field labor), she having
been raised a house-servant, and, by rare chance, blessed
with a mistress who gave her personal attention to the
comfort of her household.</p>

<p>Auntie’s house boasted glazed windows, two rooms and
a loft; and the broad boards of her floors were so clean
and white that her kitchen was quite inviting as dining-room
and sitting-room also.</p>

<p>Her iron tea-kettle shone and steamed beside a small
cherry back-log upon the great hearth, which spread below
the wide “Dutch-back” chimney, while the hoe-cakes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
“keeping” between a blue-edged earthen plate, and a bright
tin pan, upon a hot stone near by, and a kettle of boiling
corn, filled the room with its sweet aroma.</p>

<p>The snowy cloth spread upon the table in the middle of
the floor, was set about with crockery almost antique,&mdash;the
gift of “old Missus’” when she “broke up,” because the
great plantation was sold for taxes.</p>

<p>During the war the Confederate and Union armies had
swept over the region in alternation, like swarms of locusts,
taking every marketable thing; Abraham Lincoln’s Proclamation
of Emancipation had freed every “hand,” and, as
the old lady had lost all her sons in the war, and all her
means to hire laborers, and would not lease to niggers, she
folded her hands and let her remaining possessions drift
from her, and finally died a pensioner upon her friends.</p>

<p>Many a time had Aunt Phoebe’s childish hands washed
these same cups and plates, while her mother cooked for
“the great house;” and as she now brought an extra large
plate, she paused, and with eyes fixed upon it, a long
stretch of years seemed to pass before her.</p>

<p>“Make hay while the sun shines,” she spelled around the
sunny picture of hay-makers in the centre of the plate;
and before her seemed to arise the placid face of her poor
mother; and again she heard her say,&mdash;“Dat’s ’de way ’dey
do at ‘de North, chile’. ’Taint ’de colored folks as does all
’de work dar’. Oh Lord! oh Lord!” I was ’mos’ free&mdash;&mdash;thought
I <i>was</i> free shor’ ’dat time Missus tuck me ’not’h
wid’ her. Mighty nice gem’men tole’ me I war free;&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
needn’t go back South no ’mo’. So I jes walks off: but,
oh laws! He didn’t know ’nuffin ’bout ’dem United States
Marshal ’dey call ’em, I ’reckon; but may be ’dey didn’t
’blong to no United States, nohow. Spex’ ’dey come from
South Caroline. ’Dey tole’ I ’jes got go ’long back wid
Missus, or ’de whole ’dem United States ’sogers’d he afe’r
me, shor; Wal, Wal, ’pears like ’day didn’t none of ’em
know nohow; fo’ nother gem’men said ’dem United States
Marshals hadn’t got ’nuffin to do wid me, nohow, ’cause
Missus’ brung me ’long herself. I didn’t run away ’nohow,
’cause I neber was so low as a runaway nigger. ’Pears like
I didn’t know who ’t believe, an so I came back ’long wid’
Missus to make shor’.</p>

<p>“Po’re ole’ Lize, she lived nex’ do’ to Missus’ hotel. She
used to set by ’de pump in ’de back yard, evenings, and
smoke and smoke. “Dar was a young miss ’dar, used to come
too, ’an talk ’wid us, ’an she tole’ Lize war free, and I war’
free, ’cause we didn’t <i>runned away</i> from ’de South. ’Reckon
she war right, now; but I didn’t know, an’ she war’ young.”
Lize was ole an’ been sick aheap, an’ wan’t ’woth much. She
was ’gwoine to be sold in St. Loo, an’ all her chillun,&mdash;five
chillun. ’<i>Dey</i> sold right smart, but no body didn’t want
Lize; but a bad man said he’d give twenty dollah.”</p>

<p>“Lize seen a mighty nice gem’man from de No’th da, an’
she got hold his feet, an’ roared an’ cried till he bought her.</p>

<p>“Wal, ’pears like he didn’t know what t’do wid her af’r
all; hadn’t got no wife, no nothin’ but lots o’ money. Well,
shoo’ ’nuff’ dat bery night he tuck mighty sick. Ole Lize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
nussed ’im night and day, six, eight weeks or mo’, till he
got well, Doctah said ’Dar’s de ole creatur dat save yo’
life. It wa’nt me, nohow.’ Wal, Mars’ Sam war mighty
good den to ole Lize. He tuck ’er off No’th, and spex
cause he hadn’t got nothin’ nor no place, he coaxed ’er
to stay wid ’is sistah. But, laws! she wa’n’t like he. She’s
cross, an’ scold ole Lize a heap, when she’s crying ’bout her
boys jes’ been sole ’way down t’ New Orleans, ’cause dey
war so high spirited like, an’ Lize wa’n’t dar to keep ’im
quiet like. Lize wanted t’ go back to St. Loo, an’ see ’er
girls. Cross woman! She tole ole Lize all dat to make ’er
fret; an’ Mars Sam ’ad writ dat, dat war why he didn’t
wan’r Lize to come back, cause he didn’t want ’er to fret.
Poor soul! couldn’t write to Mars’ Sam.</p>

<p>“Laws, I’s young an’ spry den, an’ wanted to be free
<i>powerful bad</i>; but de Laud he say, I mus’ stay right yere,
an’ cook for Missus, a slave all my life, maybe.” Fresh
and clear as when first spoken, Aunt Phebe seemed to hear
these tales which once impressed her youthful mind.</p>

<p>And then right between the hay-makers and Auntie’s
eyes there came another picture. She could see the great
smoke rolling up over the woods beyond the cotton field,
and hear the cannon’s roar, and the shells screeching and
crashing through the trees, and see “old Missus” wringing
her hands and weeping, and praying the good Lord to
spare her four sons who were fighting in the confederate
ranks; and all the slaves were praying for the “Yankees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>”
while they exhausted every means to soothe and comfort
“old missus.”</p>

<p>That same night, when the house servants were all in her
cabin except Lucy, who was “staying wid Missus,” Uncle
Tim, the plantation preacher, was repeating what scripture
passages he could remember, there came a loud rap on the
closed door behind.</p>

<p>“If yo’ de Laud o’ de Debbil,” said Uncle Tim, “in de
name ob de Laud, I tell yo’ come in,” and a Yankee soldier
entered.</p>

<p>There she could see him stand in the light of the “fat
pine” which Tim put on the fire&mdash;the “Lincom Soger”&mdash;repeating
the Proclamation of Emancipation. How plainly
he stood out now! and the great light that shone around
him seemed almost to smite her blind as it did then.</p>

<p>There was dear old granddaddy, with wrinkled hands that
had toiled without recompense for nearly a century, clasped
tightly together. How slowly and easily he slipped
from his chair onto the floor! She thought he was kneeling;
but when she bent to help him, she heard his whisper, “Free
into glory! Free into glory! ’Tain’t no niggah <i>slave</i> yo’
comin’ fo’, Angel!” and his withered lips closed forever on
earth, while his “new song,” broke forth from lips of fadeless
bloom, in a land where love makes slavery impossible.</p>

<p>And there she saw “Mammy”&mdash;the dear form swaying
backwards and forwards as she wept and moaned, “Oh,
wicked, cruel man to cheat poor slaves! It is too good for
true! <i>too good for true!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, before Aunt Phebe, opened the two deep
graves where they buried them side by side, father and
daughter, grandfather and mother. The tardy emancipation
that had opened slavery’s dungeon had opened
also the pearly gates for the aged and the invalid.</p>

<p>The big hot tears were rolling slowly down Auntie’s
cheeks and threatening a briny shower upon the hay-makers,
when Uncle Jesse’s step upon the threshold startled her,
and the plate fell to the floor and broke into a score of
pieces.</p>

<p>She dropped into a chair, threw her apron over her head,
and wept aloud.</p>

<p>“Wal! wal! wal!” said her husband, as he scraped the
soil from his shoes at the door, “crying that way about a
broked up plate? Oh! it’s one old Missus gave yo’,” he
added, as he approached the fragments.</p>

<p>As suddenly as her grief had seemed to come, she flung
her apron from her face, tossed up both her arms, and
broke into a loud, clear strain; laughing, clapping her
hands, shrieking and stamping her feet:</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">“Glory and honor, praise King Jesus!<br />
“Glory and honor, praise de Lamb!<br />
“Oh Jesus comin’ dis way<br />
“Don’t let your chariot wheels delay!<br />
“Jesus Christ comin’ in his own time;<br />
“Take away de mudder leabe the baby behind.”</p>

<p class="p1">“Oh you got that wrong,” said Uncle Jesse, who, with
his two workmen had joined lustily in the chorus. It’s
“Take away the baby, leave the mother behind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">“I sings it jes as I wants it,” replied his wife. “De Laud
he tuck my mudder, an’ he lef’ me behind.”</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">“Give me grace fo’ to run dat race,<br />
“Heaben shall be my hidin’-place;<br />
“Wet or dry, I means to try<br />
“To get up into heaben when I die.<br />
“If yo’ get dar befo’ I do,<br />
“Tell dem I am comin’ too.</p>
<p class="pp7">“Glory and honor, praise &amp;c.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">“God be callin,’ trumpet be soundin’;<br />
“Don’t dat look like judgment day?<br />
“De tombs be bustin’, de dead be risin’,<br />
“De wheels ob time shall not be no mo.</p>
<p class="pp7">“Glory and honor, praise, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">“Chariot dartin’ to de new grabe-yard;<br />
“Go down angels and veil wid de sun;<br />
“Go down angels and veil wid the moon,<br />
“Fo’ the wheels ob time shall not be no mo.”</p>
<p class="pp7">“Glory and honor, praise, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="p1">“It’s de Debbil’s bad luck! fo’ I <i>seen</i> dat plate gwoine
down on de flo’; but I sung to de Laud, an’ He’ll break de
cha’m,” said Auntie, with the evident satisfaction of one
who has been at once shrewd and dutiful. (It is thought
an ill omen to see crockery fall, if it breaks.)</p>

<p>“Auntie, I shall like mighty well to see dat chariot
comin’, when I sho’ de Laud is in it, said Brother Johnson,”
the class leader, who was one of the workmen, “but
jes at dis pertickeler time I wants to be gnawin’ one o’ dem
cawn-cobs in dat skillet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“A wicked an’ a glutton man de Laud He despise,” she
retorted, as she arose, and casting a reproving glance upon
the offender proceeded to “dish up” the repast. Meanwhile
Brother Gibson struck up the following:</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">“I lub my sistah, dat I do!<br />
“Hope my sistah may lub me too:<br />
“If yo’ get dar yo’ gwoine to sing an’ tell<br />
“De fo’ arch-angels to tune de bell.”</p>

<p class="p1">Supper was announced just as the sun reached the
“hour mark” upon the cabin floor, which had done duty as
indicator of the time for the evening meal for many
months; and further musical exercises were indefinitely
postponed.</p>

<p>The repast had not yet been disposed of when the voice
of a man was heard calling, “Whoop! whoop!”</p>

<p>“That is Den Bardun,” said Uncle Jesse, as he sprung
from the table to the door.</p>

<p>“Hello! What’s wanted?” he shouted in reply.</p>

<p>“Man here from Baconsville wants help. Says they’re
killing all the colored people over there. Will you go?”</p>

<p>“Come over; come over, and bring him along;” and
Uncle Jesse hastened back to the table to finish his meal
while the twain should be pacing the two hundred
yards intervening between the two dwellings.</p>

<p>They entered presently, both much excited, and the
Baconsville man bearing a double barreled shot-gun.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” asked the host, gulping down a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
half cup of coffee and leaving the table to greet his guests.
“I couldn’t hear half you said.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! Matter enough!” replied Den. “Tell him,
Sterns.”</p>

<p>“Why, the town of Baconsville is just running over of
armed white men&mdash;rifle-clubs, regular cavalry companies,
and they’re going to kill all the niggers, ravish the
women, and burn the houses, and put all the children to
death!”</p>

<p>“No! no! no!” cried Uncle Jesse. “Tell a man something
he can believe now! They won’t do no such thing
as that. The white folks has got more sense ’n that. They
won’t do no such things, and I don’t believe it! You are
scart and excited.”</p>

<p>“Just go and see then, Mr. Roome. If you don’t believe
me, may be you won’t believe your own eyes,” replied the
man.</p>

<p>“Well, Roome, come on! Let’s go and see for ourselves;
for if it is true, we ought to help,” said Brother Gibson.</p>

<p>“No sir! You just wait, and keep inside the law!” said
Jesse Roome, after scratching his head thoughtfully a
moment. “I believe in <i>law</i>, and them that has kept inside
the law is the ones that is coming out ahead.”</p>

<p>Sterns then gave a graphic description of the incidents,
threats, and indications in Baconsville, up to the close of
the court-scene at about half past four o’clock.</p>

<p>Of course the whole group were intensely excited,
and Aunt Phebe listened, shrieked, and prayed by turns;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
but Uncle Jesse was still firm in his first decision to keep
inside the law.”</p>

<p>“There’s been heaps of threats, I know, enough to make
a man intimidate of his shadow; but there’s a pile o’ bluster
and brag in these old aristocrats; just like a barking
dog though, he’ll never bite.”</p>

<p>“Heigh! but they be a biting <i>now</i>, sho,” said Sterns
with a shrug.</p>

<p>“And then our folks ha’n’t always done right,” Mr.
Roome continued. “It’s a new thing for us to make laws
and be officers, and all that; and some thinks ’cause they
make the laws, that they needn’t keep ’em; and some is
mighty ambitious, and likes to pay off old scores through
the laws. Now that a’n’t right, and it can’t do no good,
nohow. Some laws has been made wrong, and some has
been executed wrong, and it a’n’t reasonable to suppose
that a man that has been a slave all his life, and ha’n’t had
nothing to do ’bout no laws only to be lashed when his
master has a mind to, is going to rise right up and know
everything at once. And the masters that has been masters
over us so long, I suppose it’s mighty hard for them
to stand the nigger majorities in this State, and have the
niggers that they used to have under them, just like that
dog now, making laws for them, and in the offices. Well,
now, we ought to think o’ these things, on both sides,
and have patience and do the best we can, and <i>keep inside
the law</i>. If the militia company and the white folks has
got up a quarrel over there in Baconsville, and either of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
them is going to breaking the laws&mdash;well, I a’n’t going over
there to join ’em in doing it! That is all.”</p>

<p>“But it’s the white folks that is breaking the laws; and
I’m surprised that yo,’ Mr. Roome, a’n’t ready to help us
against ’em. They’re all there, mounted and armed, and
officered; and they says they shall have these men and their
guns. The militia ha’n’t got guns enough there, and not
scarcely no ammunition; and they’re just going to be massacred!”</p>

<p>“No! no!” replied Uncle Jesse, “that won’t be done.
Them white folks know we’ve got a Governor and courts.”</p>

<p>“But there’s too many of ’em for the courts to stop ’em.
There’s two or three thousand, all armed, and some of ’em
is the biggest men in the State, the old aristocrats; and
the Governor’s militia can’t do nothing against these Rifle
Clubs yo’ know, these old confederate soldiers that served
in the war. They’re all <i>them</i>, or the one’s they’ve trained
up, are officering now.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” said Jesse, “but you know there’s the
United States. The United States won’t see us killed off
that way.”</p>

<p>“‘Cause the United States is <i>too fur off</i> to see it; and
when we’re all killed, the United States can’t bring us alive
again.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they just let them two young fellows go
through that company in the first place on the 4th of July?
It’s mighty provoking to see the niggers celebrating the
4th with the same flag <i>they</i> used to brag so much about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
’fore the wa’, (though they have hated it ever since), and
the State guns, and all! We’ve growed so big now, we
can afford to stoop down to such little fellows as they’ve
got to being. What’s the use o’ keeping up a quarrel when
we’ve got to live together?”</p>

<p>“Now, Jesse,” said Den Bardun, “we’ve been stooped
mighty nigh double all our lives, and our fathers and
grandfathers before us, and some of their backs is getting
stiff. It’s well enough to make a bow, but some folks don’t
enjoy being rid over, and I reckon <i>yo’r one</i>.”</p>

<p>“I can’t stay to hear yo’ talk, and if yo’ a’n’t men enough
to go and help yo’ neighbors when they is getting jist
<i>slayed</i>, I’m gwine to find some <i>men</i> somewhar; and if ever
yo’ wants help like us, to save yo’ life and property, maybe
yo’ll get it. I hope so,” and Sterns hastened away.</p>

<p>Uncle Jesse paced up and down the room for some moments,
with his arms folded and his chin upon his breast;
while Den Bardun leaned against the door-post, and
watched alternately this neighbor and the chickens a hen
was endeavoring to call into a coop in which she was confined
near the door.</p>

<p>“It <i>seems</i> hard! It does seem hard!” said Roome, without
raising his eyes from the floor, “and it seems cruel
like, I know it does. But it is <i>right</i>! <i>I know it is right!</i>
and I feel it right in my breast,” looking up with an
assured manner, and striking his broad chest with his
palms. “Sit down, Den, sit down. What do you think
about this doings?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“I believe it’s a mighty hard affair, and I’m afraid it’s a
big one; and I don’t believe it’s all about the 4th of July
scrape, either. It’s more like the democratic party, and
they’re playing off that it’s the militia.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so, Dan?”</p>

<p>“Well, Deacon Atwood, he says to me the other day,
says he, “All the officers of the Republican party has got to
be killed out, shor;” and I asked him what for?”</p>

<p>“Was he talking of the colored officers or of all of ’em?”</p>

<p><i>White</i> and <i>black</i>, making no exceptions. He says,
“we’re going to have this election, and the only way we
can get it, will be to kill out the leading men, and then the
ignorant men will do right.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Atwood came here the other day,” said Jesse, “I’d
hired Mott Erkrap, you know, to work for me, and he left
me because I wouldn’t give him 4th of July; and he wanted
to come back, and I wouldn’t take him back. The
Deacon came concerning him, and he said then that the Republican
party, before long, was going to ketch the Devil,
(Uncle Jesse lowered his voice as if in awe of his Satanic
Majesty.) Says he “There’ll be worse than seventy-seven
claps of thunder striking right against them. Of course
we was astonished at his speaking so rash and ’reverent
right here in the yard. We was all very much astonished,
me and my wife, and Mott Erkrap, and a stranger from the
city that came with Mott, at his speaking so rash and
’revrent at what would happen to the Republican party in
short time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hark!” exclaimed Aunt Phebe, raising her hands. “Oh,
Lord! they be a killing ’em!”</p>

<p>The sound of small arms came unmistakably upon the
evening air.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! It takes more’n one bird to make a spring. It
a’nt so strange to hear a gun fire!” said Uncle Jesse; at
the same time approaching the door to listen.</p>

<p>“But there’s another! and another! and heaps of ’em!”
said she, becoming almost frantic with excitement.</p>

<p>“Good Lord! they be a fighting!” exclaimed both Dan
and Jesse.</p>

<p>Several of the nearer neighbors soon came running up,
breathless and alarmed, to ask what should be done.</p>

<p>“What <i>is</i> all we gwoine to do, Uncle Jesse?” asked a
small coal-black man, rushing up to the yard, gun in hand.
“Don’t ye think we ought to go down and help ’em!&mdash;!&mdash;!
but it’s awful to hear them guns and stand here with my
good rifle in my hands doing nothin’;” and he strode back
and forth in front of the door where the group was standing,
clasping his trusty weapon to his breast.</p>

<p>“You’d best remember the Lord in such a time as this,
anyhow, and not be swearing,” replied Roome. “The
more goes there, the worse and the bigger that fuss has got
to be, and the more colored people will get killed any how
for the whites has got to beat. No, no, Penny you’d best
keep away if you don’t want to be killed.”</p>

<p>“I wonder where Deacon Atwood is?” asked Den
Bardum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“He a’n’t there, you may be shor. He’ll talk big, and put
the rest up, but keep safe hisself,” said Jesse.</p>

<p>“How about that Sheriff’s office?” and Penny looked
significantly at both Jesse and Den.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Den, “we three did promise to get
him nominated on the Republican ticket, didn’t we?
He was mighty in love with our Governor then.”</p>

<p>“But the Governor won’t support this kind of doings,”
said Roome.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious! Just hear the guns!” said Penny,
“We’ll see fire pretty soon. They’ll be burning houses,
certain.”</p>

<p>“I do hope this isn’t our folks begun this,” said Jesse.
“I hope they’ll keep inside the law, and then the United
States can protect us, and not let the white folks here kill
us all off. But if our folks begun this, the good Laud
knows what will become of us all. If Deacon Atwood goes
in for this kind of thing, I’ll go back on <i>him</i>; for I won’t
stick to any body that violates the law. My motto is to
punish every man, white and black, that violates the law.
It does seem mighty hard to stand here, and hear them
guns, and believe that somebody’s getting killed; but I
feel in my breast that it is the right thing to do. Does
any of you know who’s gone over from Bean Island?&mdash;any
of the neighbors?”</p>

<p>“Of the white folks? or the colored?”</p>

<p>“Either one.”</p>

<p>“Dr. Ave, Joe Ennery, Coot Hogg, and Ramal Bardun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
John Rammel, and Robert Blending has gone; and Captain
Black, and Williams, and I expect the Payne boys.”</p>

<p>“Do you <i>know</i> that, Penny?” and Uncle Jesse bit his
lips.</p>

<p>“Yes, I met them near sundown, gallopping hard that
way; or rather, I didn’t meet the Payne boys.”</p>

<p>“Hist! There comes the old man.”</p>

<p>“Good evening Mr. Payne,” said the host, extending his
right hand in a cordial welcome, while with his left he
made a sign behind his back, commanding caution.</p>

<p>This was clearly visible, though the sun’s light had entirely
faded; for the cabin door, near the outside of which
they stood, was wide open, and a fire of fat pine was filling
the broad chimney’s throat with a sheet of flame.</p>

<p>“Old man Payne” was a small man, with a large head,
quick, deep-set gray eyes, under a broad brow which was
crowned with snowy hair.</p>

<p>He it was who had counselled discretion, moderation and
honorable dealing at the Club meeting at which Watson
Atwood was initiated into the mysteries of modern southern
politics.</p>

<p>A descendant of an honored southern family, he yet
seemed from infancy to have inherited many notions which
were antagonistic to the environments of his childhood,
and which several seasons spent in New England, in the
early home of his mother, served to strengthen and intensify.</p>

<p>His wife, always fully Southern in ideas and sympathies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
had reared their children so, aided by their surroundings,
while he had very quietly cherished his own sentiments.</p>

<p>A chair was brought, and he seated himself without
speaking, sighed heavily, folded his small nervous hands,
and gazed away into the darkness; and as volley followed
volley, he shuddered, and wept.</p>

<p>“Good God,” said he at length, “I had hoped this kind
of thing was over! Jesse, what do you know about
this?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” was the prompt reply. “I know nothing;
at least, I’ve just <i>heard</i> that there’s a fuss between the
Militia company and the white folks. Do you know who’s
in it, Mr. Payne. Who begun it, I mean?”</p>

<p>“I only know they say the officers would not go to
court, but just fortified themselves in the armory, and defied
the law, and said they were going to fight. Joe Morey
says they’ve been making awful threats lately, and so the
Rifle clubs were called out to sustain General Baker, who
undertook to conduct the suit for Robert Baker and
Gaston.”</p>

<p>“Defied the law? How’s that, Mr. Payne?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know Jesse, but that is what Joe Morey
said.”</p>

<p>“Is that all you know about it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Has any body gone over from here, from the Island, I
mean?”</p>

<p>“Yes, some on both sides, I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“And what is the intentions of the white folks?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, except that they intend to get some
security that the negroes shall give up their guns, and stop
drilling. They say they do not feel secure in their lives
and property while the Militia is drilling with arms in
their hands.”</p>

<p>“What has the colored people ever done? And why don’t
they treat them so well that they won’t be afraid of them?
They’re State Militia.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know that Jesse; but our boys will listen to
nothing. I’m afraid of the consequences, and do not want
another war.”</p>

<p>“A good many of ’em is pretty old “boys,”&mdash;old Confederate
soldiers,” said Roome, “and there can’t be much
that is worse than this, judging by the guns we hear.
How do you know there’s any gone?”</p>

<p>“They went by my store, and I tried to persuade them
not to go.”</p>

<p>“Who was they?”</p>

<p>“I can not give names, Jesse.”</p>

<p>“Did Hankins go, Mr. Payne?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell, Jesse; but I’m glad you are all here.
If you stay here, you will not be hurt. But I didn’t think
till now,&mdash;&mdash;some of them may be straggling off here,
and I had better go back to my store,” and the old man
walked sadly away.</p>

<p>The night had set in, dark and moonless; and an hour’s
brisk discharge of small arms was followed, (after an interval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of respite), by the booming of cannon, which heightened
the terror and direful forebodings of the listeners.</p>

<p>Uncle Jesse’s dwelling became a tabernacle to the Lord
that night; for from it arose the ceaseless voice of true
prayer&mdash;“the soul’s sincere desire,” through all those hours
of darkness and terror, till just ere the dawn of the Sabbath
morning, his neighbors departed to their several places of
abode.</p>

<span class="wn">THE SITUATION.</span></h2>

<p class="pp18">“Peace fool!</p>
<p class="pp10">I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will not.”</p>
<p class="pr4"><span class="smcap">Shakespere.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Uncle Jesse</span>, as the reader is by this time aware, was a
man of influence among his neighbors, few of whom, of
either race, were capable of such just and comprehensive
views of their political and social relations.</p>

<p>Little influenced by color prejudice (which is common to
both races, though from widely different causes and in
various degrees, throughout the United States), he possessed
great reverence for law, as such; a fact mainly due to a
residence of several years among the law-abiding people of
that portion of the State of Ohio known as The Western
Reserve, at a period when his mind was peculiarity receptive.</p>

<p>Born a slave in 1834, he seized the first opportunity
offered by the late war, to flee from bondage and learn to
live like a man.</p>

<p>Aunt Phebe preferred to wait with their two little children,
her invalid mother, and aged grandfather, for the
coming of the “Yankees,” which was confidently and hopefully
expected.</p>

<p>And so in 1867 Uncle Jesse returned and found her and
their children free, and thriving, in the same cabin in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
he left them, though the “big house” was vacant, and the
plantation in new hands.</p>

<p>At that time the Southern States were rife with utter
lawlessness and bitter animosities; and acts of malicious
and cruel outrage were frequent occurrences.</p>

<p>From the first settlement of the State, society had been
divided into many and antagonistic classes, throughout
which, however, prevailed an universal and sycophantic
<i>aping</i>, each class of that above it; while the upper stratum
sat in serene security of social distinction&mdash;fortune or misfortune,
personal respectability or degradation, culture or
ignorance, plethora or poverty, <i>all</i> were forgotten or obscured
in the penumbra of that formidable and enigmatical
word <i>birth</i>, untitled though it must be.</p>

<p>Now that the old landmarks had to some extent been
swept away, there followed a general and tumultuous
scramble in the debris, each being anxious to secure all that
was possible, or failing, to resent the affront of another’s
success.</p>

<p>Thus the worst elements and characteristics of every class
were made prominent.</p>

<p>Families bred in opulence, and accustomed to claim the
unpaid toil of others as their rightful due, and to believe
political leadership and oligarchal control their birth-right,
and who, like their ancestors for generations, cherished contempt
for all who worked for their own subsistence, found
extreme humiliation in laboring for their own bread, and
submitting to the legal restrictions imposed by the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
government, controlled as it was by those they had formerly
derided as the “mud-sills” of the North, even though
those restrictions were equitable and generous. In resentment
of the equal citizenship conferred upon their former
chattled slaves, they committed, and defended in each other,
such outrages upon the persons and property of the negroes
and resident northern whites, as are not even admissable
between civilized enemies at open war.</p>

<p>Not a few planters who formerly owned thousands of
acres of land, and from three to five thousand slaves,
were, by the failure of the Rebellion, for the success of which
they had staked all their possessions, as poor as the “cracker”
families, which had formerly “squatted” like caterpillars
and locusts upon the skirts of their plantations. They were
even sometimes subjected to these as magistrates and officials,
as they often were to their former slaves.</p>

<p>This haughty planter-race, having utterly failed in its
last great pretension in bitterness of spirit still cherished
its disdain for those it could not conquer, into which disdain
the education of two hundred and fifty years of
<i>irresponsible ownership of laborers</i> has concentrated the
egotism, the selfishness and the cruelty thus engendered.</p>

<p>The intelligence of this class was never commensurate
with its wealth. Schools were necessarily few in
the South during the existence of slavery, and family
feuds and favoritisms notoriously controlled the distribution
of the honors of those that did exist, and social and
political distinction depended upon culture in no degree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Hence there was little to spur the laggard, or to encourage
and inspire genius, and the actual ignorance, or at best,
the superficial scholarship of “the first families” was astounding.
Since the war, poverty and aversion to the North
have materially lessened southern patronage of northern
schools, and under the “carpet-bag” administration the higher
schools of the State, and the common schools in country
districts in which the aggregate number of pupils did not
warrant the opening of more than one school, were
accessible to colored students; a recognition of equality
which the whites would not tolerate; and so they consigned
themselves to ignorance.</p>

<p>The class formerly known as “sand-hillers,” “crackers,”
or “poor white trash,” were lazy, filthy and ignorant,
and frequently degraded below the level of the slaves.
These, with the class next above them in the social scale&mdash;the
“working people,” who owned few or no slaves,
and labored with their own hands on small farms, or as
mechanics, experienced a social promotion nearly equal to
that of the slaves; as emancipation, the ravages of war,
and a more general distribution of land, through confiscation
and sales for delinquent taxes, broke up the land monopoly
and political retainership which had so long existed
to the opulence of the planters, and the semi-mendicity of
the lower classes.</p>

<p>The confederate service had also given acceptable occupation
and wages, and even some inferior military titles to
men who had formerly begged, or stolen, or starved, rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
than earn their bread by honest labor; and such military
glory, won in defence of “The Lost Cause,” could not be
utterly ignored in the contest for recognition of some sort.</p>

<p>The class called “respectable people,” consisting of
artists, merchants and professional men, teachers, &amp;c.,
whose title to recognition rested upon wealth and culture,
probably received the change with the most equilibrity,
while the freedmen had everything to gain, and nothing to
lose.</p>

<p>The most ignorant of them well knew that it was to
“de Yankees,” “de Lincum sogers, de United States,” or
“Mar’s Lincom,” that they were indebted for emancipation.
The raving of their masters against northern abolitionists
was, to them, quite sufficient evidence that somehow
the war had its origin, near or remote, in northern
antagonism to slavery.</p>

<p>History will never fail to record the good behavior of
the freedmen of the southern states of America, the
causes of which were manifold.</p>

<p>The experiences and legends of the slaveship, and centuries
of repetition of similar evidence, had taught the
African that there were other powers, stronger than brute
force, which he could not command.</p>

<p>Again, he was not self-liberated. The brother of his
master had been his deliverer (whatever may have been
his motive), and gratitude, the moral attraction of gravitation,
is the strongest moral power in the universe; which
the All-Father well knew when He sent His Son to suffer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>This deliverer, this brother, believed in <i>law</i>, the invisibility
and incomprehensibility of which appealed to the
superstition of the emancipated slaves. This northern
brother had struggled desperately with the tyrant, poured
out his treasure and shed his blood without stint in the
conflict; and having conquered, stood with weapons in
either hand, to command the peace in the name of this
invisible and incomprehensible <i>law</i>; while the religious,
industrial, and educational influences which he summoned
from his northern home, coming up while yet the atmosphere
was tremulous with the sounds of expiring conflict,
brought food for hungry bodies, intellects and souls; healing
for lacerated spirits; and the vesture of a better civilization
for the nakedness of the black, and the mail-chafed
form of the white.</p>

<p>Women who pressed to the battle-front with a cup of
water for the lips of the dying, and a pillow for the
wounded head that lay upon the bloody sward, from hearts
baptized to self-sacrifice, and pens lit with the zeal of the
Nazarene, sent white-winged, burning messages all over
the news-reading North; and while from thousands of
homes there, brave men came with flaunting flags, and
beating drums, and booming cannons, singing as they
marched:</p>

<p class="pp7 p1">“We are coming, Father Abr’am,<br />
Three hundred thousand more,”</p>

<p class="pn1">and</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“We’ll hang Jeff Davis on a sour apple tree.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p class="pn1">(and voluntarily broke that pledge,) from out those same
homes stole a procession of women, not clandestinely, not timidly,
but brave of soul and strong of heart and inflexible of
purpose, though without ostentation. The bible and spelling-book
were their only weapons, and their song was of
“the mercies of the Lord forever,” and their “trust under
the feathers of His wings!” “Neither the terror by
night,” “the arrow by day,” “the pestilence in darkness,”
nor “destruction at noon,” nor the “thousand falling on
their right hand,” and on their left, could make them
afraid; “because they had made the Lord their strength,
even the Most High their refuge.” They went forth to
“tread upon the lion and the adder, the young lion and the
dragon.” Scorn, insult, slander, poverty, loneliness, sickness
and death, they trampled under their feet; for
“through the work of the Lord were they made glad,” and
they “triumphed in the work of His hands.”</p>

<p>Away on in the Elysian fields of heaven, when the cycles
of eternity shall have encircled the universe, and rolled
back upon their track in such repeated and intricate mazes
as only the Infinite mind can trace, they shall receive from
the lips of the ransomed of all nations, “the blessing of
those once ready to perish”; and the blessed assurance
that the torch they lit in the freedman’s hut, lit a beacon
that illumined the world.</p>

<p>If the South is saved to civilization, its chief human
savior was “the nigger school-teacher.”</p>

<p>To these evidences of kindly interest on the part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Northern people, and the influence of, and confidence implied
in the immediate presence of feminine representatives
of the best and most peaceable element of the North, certainly
not less is due than to the natural timidity of the race,
or their great faith in ultimate Divine deliverance, which
needed intelligent direction.</p>

<p>Evidently the most difficult lesson, and yet that most
needed by all the former inhabitants of the southern states
is <i>reverence for, trust in, and submission to law</i>. The
old habit of irresponsible authority, of domination instead
of true democracy&mdash;the idea that the sovereign citizen
may be superior to the law enacted by the popular will, is
hard to eradicate.</p>

<p>Like the writhing beheaded serpent, which responds with
slow-dying malice to the glow of the sun that does not
make night because its green eyes are sightless, beheaded
slaveocratic feudalism blindly ejects its spite at inevitable
oncoming civilization.</p>

<p>Through the philanthropic movements which have been
indicated, an entirely new ingredient was injected among
the heterogeneous elements of southern society which
were seeking a new basis, and a few northern soldiers,
enamored of the delicious climate and naturally productive
soil to which war and conquest had introduced
them, and from which slavery had formerly excluded
them, brought their families from Northern homes, or married
daughters of this sunny land, and became permanent
residents. Then followed capitalists, allured by the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
apparently good investments the almost universal
bankruptcy afforded.</p>

<p>With these came money, and such industry, enterprise,
skill and public spirit as was before unknown in that
slavery-cursed land; and the pecuniary results of which the
Southerner can only account for by supposed political corruption
or downright stealing from the public funds&mdash;the
most familiar means.</p>

<p>Still the formerly favored class, true to its arrogance,
and not ignored by those accustomed to worship at its
shrine, ranks the possessor of one of its patronymics,
especially if garnished by military title won or sustained
in confederate service, among the most enviable of men;
for “The Lost Cause” is as dear to South Carolinians as
ever&mdash;an ideal worshiped all the more devoutly because of
its unreality, and with demonstration necessarily somewhat
restrained.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Immediately</span> after the interview of the four colored men
with General Baker, Rives hastened to the drill-room, where
he soon found the Captain of the militia company.</p>

<p>“Doc,” said he, “Gen. Baker says if you do not give up
the guns, he will melt the ball down before ten o’clock to-night.”</p>

<p>“Judge, just step this way,” and the Captain took him
through a communicating door into his own bedroom adjoining.</p>

<p>“General,” said he, in a confidential tone, “yo’ are the
Major General of the militia of this Division, isn’t yo’?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Now, here. I am willing to do this. I’ve sent for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Colonel, over and over, three times, but he don’t come.
Now, while I believe that, under the law, I have no right
to give up the guns to yo’ but yo’ being the General of
Militia, I will give yo’ these guns to keep, if yo’ will take
’em and take my chances.”</p>

<p>“I have no right to take those guns out of your hands,”
replied Rives, (too glad that it was so.) “The law
does not give me any such right, and I’m not going to demand
them. You can do just as you please. I want the
thing to be settled, if possible, but I don’t demand the
guns.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Captain Doc, “if yo’ don’t take ’em, I
don’t intend to give ’em up to General Baker.”</p>

<p>“You do not say that you intend to fight?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I don’t say anything of the kind; but I don’t
intend to give up the guns to General Baker; but if yo’ will
take ’em to relieve the responsibility of blood being shed
in town from me, I will give ’em to yo’.”</p>

<p>“No. I have no right to demand them. Yo’ must use
your own discretion about it,” replied Rives.</p>

<p>“Well, if that is the way yo’ are going to leave me, I’m
not going to give ’em to General Baker.”</p>

<p>Doc then hastily penned the following note and dispatched
it:</p>

<p>“Gen. Baker:&mdash;These guns are placed in my hands, and
I am responsible for them, and have no right to give them
up to a private citizen; I cannot surrender them to you.”</p>

<p class="pi6">Signed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">A reply came.</p>

<p>“I must have the guns in fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Doc coolly remarked, “then he’ll have to take
’em by force, and I shall not be responsible.”</p>

<p>He was in the armory with less than forty men, only
twenty-five of whom were members of the militia company;
the others having fled there unarmed, for protection.</p>

<p>“Now boys,” said he, “we may as well settle down to
work, for we are in for it, shor. Yo’ keep away from them
windows, for any of ’em will be firing in here. I’ll go on
top of the roof, and see what they’re doing.”</p>

<p>So saying he ascended through a scuttle, and took observations</p>

<p>General Baker was riding hither and thither, assisted by
his aid, the Colonel of the same name. As he waved his
gloved hand, and indicated their positions, the men immediately
assumed them.</p>

<p>First, twenty-five or thirty men were stationed in front
of the armory. The building, as has already been stated,
stood facing the river, and the broad street before it was
not less than one hundred and fifty feet in width.</p>

<p>Next, behind an abutment of one of the railroad bridges
fifteen or twenty more were placed, and still further down
the stream thirty or forty more. A continuous double line
of cavalry encircled the entire square, while up the river’s
bank, near and above the scene of the encounter of the
young men and the militia company on the 4th, stood some
hundreds more in reserve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>With all the consequential airs of an officer who knows
himself for a great General about to win for his already
honor-burdened brow fresh wreaths that shall be amaranthine
General Baker proceeded to place squads of men
here and there, on the corners of the streets and in other
commanding positions, clear across the sub-level half-mile
from the river to the hills, and even upon its slope, till all
the streets were thoroughly picketed and guarded, and
escape made presumably impossible. Seeing all this Captain
Doc descended to his men, and distributed them between
the windows, and in the front corners of the room, under
protection of the walls.</p>

<p>“Jes, see ’dem five men’s settin’ on deir hosses,
ovah ’dar on de rivah-bank!” said corporal Free, rising
upon his knees from his crouching position below one of
the high windows, and peeping out. “Cap’n, I don’t like de
looks of tings out dar!”</p>

<p>“Well, then, don’t look out, but make yor’self easy, and
stay right where I put yo’.”</p>

<p>“That’s jest what we’re bound to do, Cap’n; we’ll make
ourselves easy and peaceable.”</p>

<p>“Dare comes Gen’l Baker from down street, on hossback,
an’ he an’t more’n fifteen yards from ’dis building! Now
he’s motioned his hand to dem five mens, an’ dey done rode
right off down towards de road bridge! Oh, laws! I seed a
mighty big crowd o’ Georgia white men coming up de street,
wid guns in deir hands;” and he hurriedly crouched down
to his former position, little knowing that the city police,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
stationed at the bridge in extra numbers, allowed no colored
people to pass.</p>

<p>“Harry Gaston and a posse is running all the women and
children out of the streets, that was looking over this way!”
said another militia man, who stood peeping out at the side
of another window. “Boys, it do look like thar’ was gwoine
to be a fight here, shor!”</p>

<p>“The Intendant asked for time to get the women and
children out o’ town, an’ General Baker said he’d give ‘half
an hour,’” said another.</p>

<p>“<i>Onus fifteen minutes</i>, it was,” roared Mansan Handle,
“Onus fifteen minutes to get ’em all out, an’ he swore
about <i>that</i>. I’m glad <i>my</i> woman’s gone.”</p>

<p>The sound of rapping at the door below was heard, and
a voice called:</p>

<p>“Doc, Captain Doc!”</p>

<p>“Don’t none o’ yo’ go near the windows, but just yo’
keep still where yo’ be,” said the Captain, who then threw
up a sash, and looking down, asked what was wanted.</p>

<p>“You see, Captain, that General Baker has all his men
ready to attack you, but he gives you one more chance.
The fifteen minutes are up, and he sent me to ask if you
are going to surrender, and give the guns up?”</p>

<p>“I can’t give them up to him. I don’t desire no fuss,
and we’ve got out of the street into our hall for the safety
of our lives, and there we’re going to remain; but we are
not going to give up the guns to anybody without authority
to take ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The messenger galloped back to his chief.</p>

<p>It was a time of too intense feeling for speech, in that
hall. A brief moment of suspense, and the sound of hoofs
was heard, and the horsemen who had been stationed in
front of the building removed to a street in the rear.</p>

<p>Then down by the river-bank came a flash, a quick, sharp
report, and a small column of smoke rose straight up into
the air. It was a signal gun, and quickly followed by a
volley from the men stationed behind the abutment of the
railroad bridge.</p>

<p>“Crash! crash! crash!” came the bullets like hail
through the glass windows, for the strong shutters had
not been closed; the little band preferring exposure to
suffocation and ignorance of the enemies’ maneuvers.</p>

<p>As the colored men had less than five rounds of cartridges,
they reserved their fire twenty or thirty minutes. Then
Captain Doc gave the order. The discipline of the men
was excellent, and their small supply was eked out by
irregular and infrequent discharges.</p>

<p>“Good Laud!” exclaimed several at once, after firing
a light volley.</p>

<p>A young man down by the abutment was seen to
throw up his arms and fall.</p>

<p>“That was Merry Walter,” said one of the men.</p>

<p>“Was it?” asked Doc. “He’s gone at his work hind side
before. Not more’n two hours or so ago, he said, “We’re
gwoine to kill all the colored men in Baconsville to-day,
and then we’ll take the women and children, and then I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
going to kill all that are against me.” That’s just the
words he said.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” was the general exclamation.</p>

<p>“<i>That’s just awful!</i>” said Friend Robins. “But he’s
gone to meet it. I a’n’t prepared to die myself, but I
shouldn’t like to meet the Laud right after saying such a
thing as that.”</p>

<p>“We may all have to meet Him ’fo’ dis job is done,”
said another.</p>

<p>The attack commenced about six o’clock, and soon
every pane of glass in the numerous windows was strewed
in fragments upon the floor, yet not one of the men was
injured, and Merry Walter was the only white man harmed
during the whole affray except one slightly wounded by
a comrade.</p>

<p>Night was coming on apace, calm, but moonless; and
Captain Doc went upon the roof again to take observations.
Several of his men were already there, though each unaware
of the presence of the others, on account of the peculiar
construction of the roof.</p>

<p>Doc there discovered that the attacking party was
gradually closing up towards the armory, and he immediately
descended again. He found the men still talking,
and seeming to have become accustomed to the straggling
shots that occasionally visited them.</p>

<p>“I think if I <i>is</i> to go, I’d send some of ’em ahead o’ me
if I had a gun,” said Pompey Conner, “but I don’t mean
to go if I can help it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yo’re mighty quiet, Watta,” said Doc.</p>

<p>“What’s the use of talking? Better be shooting. It’s a
pity we cannot clear out all that vermin.” (With a gesture
of disgust.)</p>

<p>Half an hour more of irregular firing against the brisk
one from outside, (where the enemy continued to approach,)
and a voice was heard there: “William McFadden, go
across the river and bring two kegs of powder, and we’ll
blow this building up.”</p>

<p>“Bring me some long arms, too&mdash;two cannon&mdash;I can’t
drive these niggers out with small arms.”</p>

<p>Only Captain Doc caught the order fully, but he recognized
the voices respectively of Colonel Pickens
(probably a descendant of a valiant Colonel Pickens, who,
in the early days of the State’s history, drove a large party of
Indians from their homes. They took refuge in a deserted house
near Little River in the present County of Abbeville, near Aiken,
Pickens <i>burned them there</i>. They died without a murmur; the few
who attempted to escape were driven back or shot by the surrounding
riflemen. The next day Captain William Black, in going from
Miller’s Block-house, on the Savannah River, heard a chain rattling
near the ruins. He paused, and found a white neighbor baiting his
wolf trap with a piece of one of the dead Indians.” <i>History of the
Upper Counties of South Carolina</i> by <span class="smcap">J. H. Logan, A. M.</span> pp 67-68),
Baker and the
gallant General, and sprung upon the roof again, but soon
hastened down, and quietly slipped from the hall down the
stairs of his private apartments, and so out upon the street.
Aided by the darkness and his own dark skin, and some confusion
just commencing in the hitherto orderly ranks of the
enemy, he soon found the weakest point in the surrounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
force. Re-entering the hall with hammer, saw and nails
from his own ample supply, he tore down boards from a
rough partition there, and constructed a rude ladder. This
he fastened securely to the sill of one of the rear windows
of the hall. By this time the men had become thoroughly
alarmed; and, but for the strong controlling influence of
their Captain, a panic must have occurred. In his immediate
presence, however, they were yet controllable.</p>

<p>“Here, Lieutenant Watta, yo’ go down first, and receive
the men; and all yo’ men follow him. Not too fast,
now! Some of us will keep firing once and awhile, and so
make them think we are here yet. I’ll go last, but yo’ receive
the men, and keep them till I come. I know just
where we’ve got to make a break, and I’ll get yo’ all off if
yo’ keep cool, and not get excited; though yo’ll have to
fight right smart to get out even the best way, for we are
surrounded.”</p>

<p>This was attempted, but when the brave Captain left the
dark, deserted hall, and reached the ground, he found but
fourteen of the men there.</p>

<p>“Where is Lieutenant Watta?” he inquired. “He’s got
excited and gone off, and controlled off the best part of the
Company. He wanted to take us along too.”</p>

<p>“Well, men, we are surrounded, and I think there is
over three thousand men here in Baconsville, and there is
more coming over from the city all the time. The lower
part of Market street is completely blocked up with ’em for
two hundred yards; looks like as thick as they can stand;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and in Mercer street it’s the same, and in Main street the
same. But right in front of the building there isn’t so
many; and if yo’re ready to fight pretty sharp and mind
orders, I’ll get yo’ out safe, maybe.</p>

<p>“We’d best go up to Marmor’s office, and out that way.
They won’t expect us to go up street towards old man
Baker’s; they’ll expect us to go towards the city bridge,
or to Sharp’s hill.”</p>

<p>While the crowd was intent upon the arrival, placing,
and firing off the cannon, the fifteen men reached the
street.</p>

<p>“Here they come! Here they come!” shouted the mob,
as the men sought to cross Main street.</p>

<p>The numbers against them were, of course, overwhelming;
but the colored men were fighting for life, and the
darkness and their dark skins were to their advantage.</p>

<p>They dodged, or hid, or ran, or stood and fought bravely,
as either best served them; till, after two or three hours of
such effort, they were all safe together out of the town,
in a strip of thick bushes which bordered “a branch” (a
small tributary of the river), in one of Robert Baker’s
fields. Only one was wounded, and be not disabled. Here
all sat down to rest and give thanks for deliverance. But
the brave Captain was troubled about the Lieutenant and
the men he had “controlled off.” He was sure they would
“get squandered;” and that if they did, they would be
killed.</p>

<p>So, leaving his comrades with many injunctions to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
there quietly, where no one would expect them to
take refuge, he returned, and through numerous hair-breadth
escapes, at length reached the besieged square.</p>

<p>The most of the houses there, as is quite common in the
South, stood upon wooden spiles, or short brick pillars, for
coolness and less miasma.</p>

<p>Imagination is active and potent in the Southerner, and
his contempt and resentment towards a “nigger” that dares
thwart the will of a white, feed his courage best when the
dark skin is visible.</p>

<p>So there stood the brave Southerners encircling that devoted
block, and firing into it at random, no one having
yet attempted search under the houses where the negroes
would be the most likely to secrete themselves.</p>

<p>But Captain Doc, escaping the bullets, called in subdued
tones under several of the dwellings, and received two or
three responses.</p>

<p>“Yo’ll get ketched here, bye-and-bye,” said he, “shor as
the worl. Yo’ come along, an’ I’ll get yo’ in a better place.”</p>

<p>With the end of his gun he knocked a few bricks
from the walled underpinning of a building that was
nearer the ground than the others.</p>

<p>“Crawl in, an’ I’ll brick yo’ up.”</p>

<p>They obeyed with alacrity, and he replaced the bricks
and went in search of other parties.</p>

<p>Looking out from a little cornfield, he saw one of the men
whom he sought, run across an adjacent garden, and called
to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The fugitive was the Town Marshal, or chief of police.
Bewildered by fight, or not recognizing the voice, the man
ran on and leaped the fence into Mercer street. The moon
had now arisen, and shone very brightly.</p>

<p>“We’ve got you now!” shouted Harry Gaston, with a terrible
oath; and with several of his comrades immediately
surrounded Carr.</p>

<p>“We’ve got you now! You’ve been Town Marshal
long enough. Going around here and arresting white men;
but you won’t arrest any more after to-night.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Gaston,” said the Marshal with the assured voice
and manner of an innocent man. “Gaston, I know yo’,
and will ask yo’ to save my life. I havn’t done anything
to yo’. I have only done my duty as Town Marshal.”</p>

<p>“Y-e-s,” replied Gaston with a sneer. “Your knowing
me a’n’t nothing. I don’t care nothing about your marshalship.
I ha’n’t forgot that five dollars you made me pay
for dipping my head in Ben’s Spring, and I’ll have satisfaction
to-night, for we’re going to kill you;” and the six men
all fired upon the unarmed Marshal at once.</p>

<p>“Oh Lord! Oh Lord!” cried the unfortunate man.</p>

<p>“You call on the Lord, you &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;?” said they.</p>

<p>“Oh Lord! Oh Lord!” rang out loud and clear upon
the midnight air, and as he uttered the words a second
time they fired again, and he fell.</p>

<p>While his flesh still quivered, southern chivalry proceeded
to draw a pair of genteel boots from his feet, and a
valuable watch from his pocket; and then left him with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
stars gazing into his dead face, and the witnessing angels
noting testimony for the inquest of a just heaven.</p>

<p>Captain Doc had climbed upon a timber of the railroad
trestle, and was looking through the tassels of corn which
grew around him and made a friendly shade.</p>

<p>“By &mdash;&mdash;!” said one of the ruffians, “I reckon some of
us had better go over in that cornfield. There’s good
hunting thar, I reckon.”</p>

<p>Stealthily Capt. Doc now crept between the corn-stalks
diagonally to the left, till he reached and entered Marmor’s
printing office, which was, like the Justice’s office, connected
with his dwelling. Here he remained an hour or more,
supposing himself to be alone, and listened to the sounds
of violence without, and of many men coming over the
long bridge from the city, whooping and yelling like
demons.</p>

<p>Then came blows upon the front door of the office,
threatening its destruction, and our Captain made his exit
through the one at the rear.</p>

<p>When Lieut. Watta had “controlled off” more than half
the men who escaped from the armory, he took them right
into the teeth of the enemy.  At once the little squad was
scattered in every direction, in their own expressive dialect,
“squandered;” but most of them soon rendezvoused in
Marmor’s printing office, entering at the back door, as Doc
and his men had done.</p>

<p>“Boys, let’s run out. They’ll ketch us here, shor,” suggested
one of the party, and opened the front door, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
quickly and noiselessly closed it again, as the foe were
numerous there.</p>

<p>“If you go that way, you’ll get killed,” said the Lieutenant;
and all immediately ran out at the back door, and
secreted themselves in the yards and under the houses; all
but Corporal Free, who crept under a counter in the office.</p>

<p>When the door was eventually broken in, and the mob
proceeded to demolish the machinery and whatever else
they could find, a fragment struck the wall, and, rebounding,
threatened the concealed head of the Corporal, who
dodged, and thus revealed his presence.</p>

<p>“Hello! There’s a great nigger poking his head out,”
exclaimed the rioters.</p>

<p>“I surrender! I surrender,” cried the poor fellow, as
they dragged him out. “Where is Gen. Baker? Where
is Gen. Baker?”</p>

<p>“Who is this?” asked one of the white men, pausing in
his work of demolition, and approaching where the light
of their lantern fell upon the face of their captive.</p>

<p>“Why it’s John Free. Don’t yo’ know me?&mdash;de man
dat libed neighbor to yo’, Tom Sutter, for a year or mo’?”
replied the prisoner. “I’m John Free, John Free. <i>Yo’</i>
know I’m a honest man as don’t do nobody no harm. I
wants to see Gen. Baker.”</p>

<p>“&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; you!” said the white man Tom Sutter, looking
down into the dark face, “you’re one of Capt. Doc’s
militia-men, first corporal. We’ll fix <i>you</i> to-night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please send Gen. Baker to me if yo’ please. He is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
a high-toned gem’man, I’ve heard ’em say, and he won’t let
any of his men hurt a prisoner dat surrenders. I tell yo’
I surrender! I surrender!”</p>

<p>“You go to &mdash;&mdash;! We’re going to fix you pretty soon;”
and beating him with their guns, they dragged him out
at the front door, and down Main and Market streets,
to a place where fifty or sixty ruffians (“the good people of
South Carolina”) stood shoulder to shoulder in a circle,
and backed by a crowd of hundreds, were guarding thirty
or forty other unarmed captives.</p>

<p>A demoniac howl of delight arose from the drunken,
blood-thirsty throng on his approach; and as each victim
arrived, the “high-toned gentleman” and “chivalrous
General and his aids applauded their subordinates with&mdash;“Good!
boys, good! (with oaths). Turn your hounds loose,
and bring the last nigger in! Can’t you find that&mdash;Capt.
Doc?”</p>

<p>There Corporal Free found his first and second lieutenants,
and with them and the others he was compelled to sit
down in the dust of the street.</p>

<p>While Capt. Doc stood at the back of Marmor’s office,
undecided which way to flee, and hearing the work of destruction
and the pleadings of the captured man within, he
looked across the gardens to his own house, and saw it
all alight, and men there breaking furniture, pictures and
mirrors dashing upon the floor, and destroying beds and
clothing. They had also commenced to scour the entire
square for their prey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>He leaped a fence which separated Marmor’s back yard
from his garden, and as he did so a gruff voice called
“Halt!”</p>

<p>At the same instant the old time slave-hunter Baker,
rushed from Dan Lemfield’s back door, pistol in hand, and
fired.</p>

<p>“&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; him! I’ve got him!” said the gray-haired
sinner, as he stooped to examine what had a moment before
been the habitation of an immortal soul, now fled for protection
to the High Court of the Universe.</p>

<p>Urged by his host, the old man re-entered the house,
repeating as a sweet morsel to his tongue, “I’ve got him!
I’ve got him!” though ignorant what “nigger” he had got.</p>

<p><i>But had he?</i></p>

<p>“Fear not them which can kill the body, and after that
have no more that they can do.”</p>

<p>Our Captain now crept softly through the little cornfield
which occupied the centre of the square, diagonally,
to the extreme corner; to the dwelling and office of the
Postmaster, and made his way to a second-story verandah
which extended the entire length and breadth of the two
rear sides of the edifice. This verandah was thickly latticed,
but a few strips were broken off, high up on the end
next Market street.</p>

<p>There he stood, looking down upon “the dead-ring” we
have already described, till day lit the east.</p>

<p>Mann Harris was a large, black man&mdash;a porter in a
store in the city opposite, and he sat among the other prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in the dust of the street almost beneath Doc’s feet.</p>

<p>Having conveyed his invalid wife to a place of safety,
he had returned to protect his property. He sauntered
about the streets, watching the current of events while
that remained safe, and then retired to his own dwelling,
probably supposing that “every man’s house is his
castle,” and he would there be at once beyond the
reach of attack, and the temptation to resentment. Peeping
down from a second-story window (for he closed the
house to give it the appearance of being deserted), he saw
‘old man Baker’ and his son Hanson standing at the
corner of his house, pistols in hands.</p>

<p>His inoffensive neighbor Pincksney approached, and was
about to pass.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” demanded Baker.</p>

<p>“I’m going to the drill-room.”</p>

<p>“You can’t go.”</p>

<p>A brief parley resulted in a repetition of the prohibition,
“I tell you, you can’t go, and you may as well go
back!” emphasized with an oath.</p>

<p>“All right,” and the colored man walked back. Soon
another attempted to pass on the opposite side of the way.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” shouted Baker.</p>

<p>“Going about my business!”</p>

<p>(A fearful oath). “You’d better go back, or I’ll shoot
you!”</p>

<p>The young man retreated precipitately, and hid in a
back yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after this the attack opened, and Mann Harris sat
in a back room of his home, listening to the terrible sounds
for hours; or with unshod feet crept across the floor lest a
footfall might be heard by some lurking foe, and watched
the flashing of guns from the windows of the armory.</p>

<p>Then followed the booming of cannon. “Good God!”
he exclaimed, “we is all done killed! They will shoot
down every house in the town! But I’ll have to take it as
it comes.”</p>

<p>He heard the shout, “Here they come! Here they
come!” and heard Baker and his friends fire upon the
negroes as they crossed the street, and Doc’s men fire in
return.</p>

<p>Four times after this the cannon shook the windows, as
it belched forth its canister, and sent terror through the
town and surrounding country.</p>

<p>The sound of small arms continued in various parts of
the village, while the debauched desperadoes sought their
victims in their hiding-places.</p>

<p>Then the familiar stentorian voice of John Carr, crying,
“Oh Lord! Oh Lord!” and the succeeding volley which
silenced it, struck terror into the poor man’s soul, and he
fell upon his knees alone in the darkened room, and with
forehead upon the floor, and trembling in every limb, he
whispered, “God Almighty, I’m an awful bad man! I a’n’t
prepared to die. Oh, save me, Jesus Christ!”</p>

<p>The discharge of firearms nearly ceased, at length,
but was succeeded by loud shouts and sounds of violence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
and cursing, the shrieks of women, and the cries of little
children, and the alarm of fire&mdash;for the ruffians dragged
the helpless innocents from their houses, some of which
they set on fire, in their zeal to arrest every ‘nigger’ and
‘radical.’</p>

<p>Harris’ house, and that of General Rives, joined and
communicated by folding doors: indeed, were only different
apartments of the same dwelling.</p>

<p>The sound of numerous heavy feet was soon heard upon
the porch. A blow, and Rives’ door flew open.</p>

<p>The occupants had fled, but the shouts and oaths, the
heavy blows, and cracking furniture, and crashing crockery
and glass, told that “the white-livered Judge” was no
exception when Republicans must suffer.</p>

<p>“Oh laws!” said Harris, mentally, “from the sound of
that smashing up of things and going on, I feel pretty bad
myself! Though they has done all the shooting niggers
in the street, the next turn will be mine, shor!”</p>

<p>He stood in the hall, ready for exit through the front
door, and when he heard the butts of their guns strike
upon the folding doors which he had secured the best he
could, he walked out upon the porch.</p>

<p>Ten or twelve blood-thirsty men stood at the foot of the
steps, and vociferated.</p>

<p>“Come down, you &mdash;&mdash; big nigger! come down!”</p>

<p>“I ha’n’t done nothing,” said Harris.</p>

<p>“No, none of you ha’n’t done nothing,” was the response,
while as many as could, laid hold upon him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
speedily, though not tenderly, conducted him to the “dead-ring.”</p>

<p>“Let me stand up,” said he, attempting to rise from the
dust where they had seated him. “A man can’t see outside
at all,&mdash;can’t see among the white folks at all.”</p>

<p>“You sit down there, you great big nigger!” said little
Gaston, sticking him with a gun; and Mann Harris sat down.</p>

<p>The next moment, with a great shout and halloa, Lieutenant
Watta was brought, and compelled to sit down close
beside Harris.</p>

<p>“Good! good! boys,” shouted the great General. “But
can’t you get that Captain? I want that Captain, now.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a looking man is he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a saucy-looking fellow, and has side whiskers
and a moustache.”</p>

<p>“I’ll write it down,” said one producing a pencil. Failing
to find paper in any of his pockets, he turned towards the
moonlight, and wrote it upon his shirt cuffs.</p>

<p>“Halloa Tom, let me have your pencil while I write it
upon my shirt-front,” said another. “The starch makes it as
good as paper. We’ll catch him before long now.”</p>

<p>Little did they think he was just above their heads,
watching their writing.</p>

<p>Watta’s white blood, which had boiled and seethed all
day and in the early evening, had spent its fury, and the
gentler nature of the man had assumed control.</p>

<p>“Oh, they’ve fotched <i>you</i>, Watta,” said Harris, really
more alarmed for him than for himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mann,” said Watta in a low tone, “what do you think
of this?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to think of it.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they will kill any of us?”</p>

<p>“Yes I do, just so.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they will kill me?”</p>

<p>“I do Watta; that I do: and all you have got to do is to
pray God to save your soul.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my poor wife and children!” cried the poor man,
softly, folding bis long thin hands across his knees and
dropped his head in the anguish of despair.</p>

<p>“Just give up your wife and children, and every
thing else, and be prepared to die,” said Harris, “for
they are going to kill you. There’s been so many envious
niggers telling lies on you, and the white folks is ‘allus’
ready to believe ’em; and they have been making such
threats about you, and I’m satisfied they’ll kill you.”</p>

<p>Watta bent his head lower, and the tears fell fast.</p>

<p>“That you?” asked Harris of another.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was hid under my own house, an’ ’dey was
gwo’ine to shoot me dar, an’ I tole ’em I surrendered, ’an
’dey brung me heah.”</p>

<p>“And Dan Pipsie! you here too?” exclaimed the inquisitive
Harris.</p>

<p>“Yes, me and Eck Morgan was on top o’ de drill-room,
along wid Sam Henry and tree or fo’ more of ’em. We
went out de back way when de cannon come, an’ we jumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
Marmor’s fence, an’ went up onto his shed, an’ got into a
back window.”</p>

<p>“Was Marmor there?”</p>

<p>“No, nobody wasn’t ’dar; only jes de white men come
’dar an’ broke open de house, an’ de out-houses, an’ dry goods
boxes; an’ we could see ’em looking to see if dar war any
niggahs’ dar. Den’ dey come into de house, an’ broke
eb’ry ting up, an’ carried off eb’ry ting; and den dey just
broke open de do’ whar’ we war; an’ Ben Grassy, an’ George
Wellman, ’dey jumped out o’ de window we got in at, an’
I don’t know war’ dey got to; but de men dey just kotched
us, and fotched us heah.”</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> “dead-ring,” as has been said, was on Market street,
and quite near the Post Master’s residence, which occupied
the corner and stood flush with both Market and Cook
streets. Captain Doc stood in the upper verandah, almost
over the heads of the crowd surrounding “the ring,” and
looked down upon them.</p>

<p>“It is about time we began the killing,” said one of the
crowd, “We’ve been hunting and capturing long enough.
Now who shall be killed?”</p>

<p>“Kill ’em all, of cose,” replied one of his fellows.</p>

<p>“We’d better find out what Gen. Baker says,” said a
third. “We’ll go round to Dunn’s store, and see what he
says. Whatever he says, I say it’ll be right.”</p>

<p>“If yo’ say <i>dat</i>, yo’ won’t kill any of us,” said Corporal
Free; “fo’ Gen. Baker is too high toned a gem’man to

<p>“You shut up your mouth,” said one of the chivalry, as
he threw a handful of dirt into Free’s face.</p>

<p>At that moment a cheer arose, and hats of all descriptions
were swung wildly in the air.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! Here comes our chief!” shouted the mob,
and made room for horse and rider to approach the ring,
though the single solid circle of armed men remained unbroken.
The poor fellows upon the ground raised their
heads, and cried out each for his life, “Oh, Gen. Baker!”
“Oh, Gen. Baker!” “You will save me!” “You will
save my life,” “Gen. Baker, I surrendered right off, I did,”
“I han’t done nothing,” “I’m just a honest, hard-working
man.” “Don’t let ’em kill me, Gen. Baker!” “Yo’ will set
<i>me</i> free, General Bakah, I’m sho fo’ yo’s a gemman!” and
beseeching hands were uplifted, and dark faces upturned
in earnest pleading for the protection they felt sure “a
high-toned gentleman,” and “chivalrous chieftain” would
give.</p>

<p>“Is William Daws here in this ring?” asked the
General.</p>

<p>“Yes sah,” was the prompt and confident reply.</p>

<p>“You’re the black rascal that burned my house down,”
and with a vile epithet this personification of southern
magnanimity rode away.</p>

<p>“Ah! Ah!” groaned the crowd, in derision of the misplaced
confidence of the negroes.</p>

<p>“There’s Alden Watta,” said a mocking voice. “You’re
a <i>magistrate</i>, I suppose! You’re a &mdash;&mdash; nice looking magistrate!”
and he scooped up a handful of soil and threw it into
the back of Watta’s neck, as his head hung down. “There’s
a baptism for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Watta did not heed it.</p>

<p>“Boys, we’d better go to work, and kill what niggers
we’ve got; what’s the use o’ waiting? We shan’t be able
to find Capt. Doc,” said a new speaker.</p>

<p>“We’ve had our orders from Gen. Baker, so far, and
we’d better get orders from him now,” said another, who
was possibly more merciful.</p>

<p>“If we don’t kill all, they’ll give testimony against us,
some day to come,” said the first speaker.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said a third. “Gen. Baker has got us here,
and we ketched the men as he told us, and I think we’ve
got something to say now.”</p>

<p>“No, gentlemen,” said a fourth, “just pick out the Republican
leaders and kill them, and let the rest go. They’re
all Republicans, I know, but they a’n’t all leaders; and some
of these boys didn’t never hurt nobody. Some of ’em is
good fellows!”</p>

<p>“A&mdash;h! that a’n’t worth a cent! We’ve come out here
to have some fun, and now let’s have it.”</p>

<p>So they contended till the excitement became quite
alarming, and pistols were drawn upon each other by the
mob.</p>

<p>“Well now,” said a new voice, “I’ll tell you how you
must do it.”</p>

<p>“Listen! Listen! Hear the Judge’s son! Hear the
the young Georgia Judge!” shouted several men; and so
there came a calm.</p>

<p>“This has been a military affair so far,” said the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
man, “and let us carry it through so. We must just have
a court-martial. These niggers are prisoners of war. This
is a conflict between the South Carolina Rifle Clubs, the
natural offspring of our honored Confederate Cavalry,
(cheers), and the National Guards, the pets of the Yankees,
(groans). The South Carolinians have been victorious,
[tremendous cheers], as they always will be, [vehement applause].
And now, as becomes the sons of noble sires,
[cheers], sons who are honored [when in uniform], by wearing
the gray of our “Lost Cause,” [cheers], and who to-night
have done honor to the gray, (cheers), let us not
forget to be generous to our prisoners; but choose from our
number twenty men, who shall retire and consider the case
of each of these we have captured; and as they decide, so
the man shall fare.”</p>

<p>Applause and assent followed, when another voice added,
“And if any of you have old scores you want settled, just
bring them before the court-martial.”</p>

<p>The men were selected, though not without difficulty
and some final dissatisfaction and threats, but as the Captain
was acceptable to the most violent, the matter was
finally adjusted upon a compromise.</p>

<p>Capt. Sweargen, [the same who menaced Mr. Springer
during the last conference held with Gen. Baker previous
to the commencement of active hostilities], withdrew and
organized his court, and soon returned to the “dead ring,”
and gave the following elegant military order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“All you black scamps, get up here; we’re going to
carry you to the county seat, and put you in jail.”</p>

<p>“No; we’ll start for there, but we’ll lose them on the
road,” said a bystander.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” said another, “we’ll leave them in the
swamp.”</p>

<p>“Come on, boys, come on this way, we’ll attend to
the&mdash;s,” said Capt. S&mdash;, and the ring and crowd moved
down the street about twenty yards.</p>

<p>“Halt! Now all you blasted niggers, sit down!”</p>

<p>“Capt. Sweargen! Capt. Sweargen!” said Mann Harris,
“As yo’ are the Captain of this killin’, I will ask yo’
to save my life.”</p>

<p>“You hush; yo’ talk too much, you great big nigger
you,” said one of the crowd.</p>

<p>“I’m gwoine to talk. It’s life or death for me, an’ I’m
gwoine to talk for my life.”</p>

<p>“Captain! Captain! Oh, don’t let them kill me!” said
Sam Henry. “I’ve allus been a industrious and honest fellow,
and ha’n’t never hurt nobody, nor stole, nor nothin’.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but you’re a blamed Republican, and so is all the
rest of yo’, and that’s enough. We’ll carry South Carolina
Democratic now, about the time we kill four or five hundred
of yo’ voting niggers. This is only the beginning of
it. We’ve got to have South Carolina, and these clubs has
got to go through the State.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added another, “the white man has got to rule
here. This is a white man’s government.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The excitement was again increasing, and all talked at
once on this topic, on which alone all seemed to agree.</p>

<p>“Now, men, we’ve got this court-martial, and must proceed
according to military law,” shouted Captain S.</p>

<p>“There a’n’t no law,” cried a voice. “The law has run
out at the end of a hundred years, and there a’n’t no constitution
neither.”</p>

<p>“There a’n’t no court in South Carolina that can try us
anyhow,” said another.</p>

<p>“That’s so! That’s so!” resounded through the crowd.</p>

<p>“Hello! Hurrah! here comes another nigger! Got
Capt. Doc this time? Capt. Doc! Capt. Doc!” (with oaths),
rang through the swaying mob which surrounded the dead
ring, as a posse from the General’s headquarters advanced
with the new victim.</p>

<p>Not without difficulty a way was opened for the conveyance
of&mdash;not Captain Doc (who was watching and listening
attentively at the Cook street end of the verandah, and
not twenty paces from the spot), but a good faced boy, yet
in his teens.</p>

<p>His eyes rolled wildly about, he trembled violently, and
his breath came quick and short, though without a sound.</p>

<p>“Oh, Friend Robbins,” said Watta, “I’m sorry they
have got you? Your widowed mother and the children
need your support. Where is Joey? (the company’s drummer-boy).”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” whispered Friend.</p>

<p>“Ha! This is the boy that wouldn’t sell us ammunition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
in Mrs. Bront’s store,” shouted one of the assassins. “I
cursed you well then, old chap; but we’ll give <i>you</i> all the
ammunition you want, and more’n you’ll ask for.”</p>

<p>Poor Friend had passed a dreadful night, (for this was
now in the small hours of the morning), since he slipped
down the ladder from the drill-room.</p>

<p>He had taken refuge in Marmor’s office, from thence fled
to the street; been driven back through the rear yard,
leaped Dan Lemfield’s fence, escaping a shot aimed at him,
hid under a pile of railroad cross-ties in Lemfield’s yard
during a dreadful hour, only then to be dragged out by
three men with pistols and lanterns in their hands, searching
every hiding place. They took him out upon the
street, and to their commander.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked the lofty General.</p>

<p>“It is Friend Robbins,” answered the boy, looking
frankly into the officer’s face.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“I have not been doing anything; the men came in there,
and brought me out.”</p>

<p>“Do you belong to the militia company?”</p>

<p>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, we killed one &mdash;&mdash; nigger down there to-night,
and I want you to go down there and see him, and see if
you know him. Two of you men take him down there.”</p>

<p>This was done; and there upon the ground lay the dead
man, his eyes wide open and staring away through the
clear, white moonlight, away from the blood-stained earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
towards that infinite One, before whose face the escaped
soul stood, corroborating the testimony of his blood which
“cried from the ground.”</p>

<p>“Who is that?” asked one of the guards.</p>

<p>“That’s John Carr,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“He’s the Town Marshal, a’n’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’ll be Town Marshal no more!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know sir.”</p>

<p>Friend was then conducted back to the General.</p>

<p>“Are you ready, sir?” asked the men, each presenting
his pistol.</p>

<p>“No; don’t kill him,” said the General, “but take him
yonder, and keep him till I call for him.”</p>

<p>They took him down under a rail road trestle, and kept
him half an hour surrounded by men, who amused themselves
by torturing him with all sorts of alarms, questions
and indignities.</p>

<p>At the expiration of that time, General Baker rode by,
and directed that he be taken to the “dead ring.”</p>

<p>“Oh, here you are Tom,” said Gaston, approaching the
corner of the Post-Master’s house. “I’ve been looking for
you. You know we’ve got Watta down there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s a streak of good luck; but I wish we
could only get hold of their ringleader, that Doc. I’m
mighty glad we’ve got Dan Pipsie, though.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and the young men laughed. “I want Doc
mighty bad too, but I’m thinking more about what we’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
going to do with what we have got. I reckon the Court
Martial is the best way. Captain Sweargon has got great
respect fo’ General Baker. They shan’t let Watta and
Pipsie off nohow.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the General, who rode up at that moment
and caught the last remark. “Watta and Dan Pipsie are
two dangerous men, and ought to be taken care of.”</p>

<p>“Now, General,” said a stumpy little man, strutting up
to that dignitary, “yo’ve brought us all here, all this
crowd, and we’ve got the niggers; and now if you won’t kill
them, they’ll just go and give testimony agin us, and get
us into trouble.”</p>

<p>The General stared at the little man with the most
serene contempt, and turning his horse’s head, rode away
without speaking.</p>

<p>But the little man was neither abashed nor silenced.
He continued,&mdash;“Here General Baker has brought us
here, and kept us up all night helping him to capture a
lot of niggers, and he ought to kill the last one of ’em; for
if he don’t they’ll be up here to vote against us, and they’ll
be giving testimony against us.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough, Volier, true enough,” said several
of his associates.</p>

<p>“I’m sleepy and tired,” continued Volier. “Here,
Bub,” addressing a small boy of twelve years, “You ought
to be abed and asleep long ago.”</p>

<p>“No, sir-<i>ee</i>,” said the boy, ejecting a volume of tobacco-juice
from his mouth. “<i>I</i> a’n’t sleepy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s go up into this piazza, and go to sleep,” urged
the little man, “Come, come on!”</p>

<p>“No, I <i>sha’n’t</i>,” replied the boy. “I want to go and
spit on them niggers some more.”</p>

<p>So the little man yielded, and accompanied the lad in
quest of his rare sport; much to the relief of Captain
Doc’s mind.</p>

<p>At the same time Gaston and Tom Baker approached
the “dead ring” also, and the name of Alden Watta was
immediately called, as that of the first victim to be sacrificed.</p>

<p>“We’ll fix you! we’r’e going to kill you now, without a
doubt,” cried the mob.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Watta, standing up in a calm
manner, “I am not ready to die, and haven’t done anything
to be killed for. Will you allow me to prepare to meet
my God? Please let me pray.”</p>

<p>“You ought to have been praying before now; you have
talked enough without praying, and we’re going to kill
you now. I don’t care,” said young Tom Baker, with
numerous oaths. “But we’re going to kill you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, gentlemen, do spare my life! I will not interfere
with you. I will only take care of my family as an honest
man should. I will go clear away out of the State, if you
will only spare me to take care of my wife and my little
children!”</p>

<p>“Watta, old chap, is that you?” cried Gaston, crowding
nearer, (with an oath). “We’ll fix you directly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Gaston! Gaston! What do you want with me?
Please do, do all you can for me, and I will be your friend as
long as I live, and leave the legacy of gratitude to my
children!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I <i>will</i> do all I can for you; I’ll do it in a short
while. He’s had time enough, boys.”</p>

<p>As many as could lay hands upon him did so, and they
carried this Second-lieutenant of the National Guards,
this County Commissioner, this graduate of a Freedman’s
High School, this teacher of a colored school, this correspondent
of the &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; <i>Times</i>, this influential Republican, this
husband and father, this young man who bore the general
reputation of being a straightforward and truthful man,
a man that could be depended on, and had a great deal of
resolution; not a violent man, not given to insolence nor
trouble of any kind, a pleasant and affable man though
one of spirit, this American citizen, and they bore him away
to be sacrificed.</p>

<p>By main force they took him several rods down the
street and into the edge of a field.</p>

<p>Each individual of the crowd panted for a share in so
great a service to southern Democracy.</p>

<p>When he was allowed to stand upon his feet again, he
looked around upon a wall of circular steel mouths, each
ready to belch forth hot, blazing, sulpherous, leaden death;
for every man presented the muzzle of his gun or pistol
at the hapless victim.</p>

<p>Falling upon his knees he cried out, with clasped hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and upturned face, “Oh, God! there is neither justice nor
mercy upon the earth! I cast my naked soul and all I have
upon Thy mercy!”</p>

<p>He paused and pressed his hands over his face. A tremendous
volley, followed, and Alden Watta’s soul leaped
into the presence of that Judge whom no Ku Klux Klans
can corrupt or intimidate; and the murderous throng
hastened back to procure another victim.</p>

<p>“Oh, Free, and all of yo’, what is yo’ gwoine on so a
beggin’ fo’?” said Dan Pipsie. “If dey is gwoine to kill us
all anyhow, what is de use o’ beggin’ so? I only wish I had
some o’ my wife’s ’ligion now; and I’d like fo’ her to pray
fo’ me.”</p>

<p>The committee soon returned from the court, and announced
the Armorer of the militia company, Dan Pipsie,
as the next condemned.</p>

<p>With an air of perfect indifference he arose and accompanied
the murderers to the field of blood.</p>

<p>A volley was heard, and the committee returned, but
Dan did not.</p>

<p>Ham Sterns was the next called. He was a large mulatto,
and was sick.</p>

<p>“O. Gentlemen!” he pleaded, “I haven’t done anything.
What do you want to kill me fo’? I a’n’t a member of the
militia company, and I was just peaceable at home when
some of you just come and dragged me out here; and now
you’re going to kill me. I a’n’t even a ’publican leader.
Please let me go!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ham Sterns, I reckon yo’ know <i>me</i>,” hissed an evil-eyed,
sallow-faced man, stepping before him, and shaking
his fist in his face. “Now I’ll be quits with you on that
sale affair; you and Alf Minton. I’ll learn yo’ to outbid
me!”</p>

<p>“Come out here! come out here?” shouted the mob, and
Ham Sterns was led away. The guns fired, and the committee
returned, but Ham Sterns never did.</p>

<p>“Oh them tremendously firings!” said Sam Henry, with
a shudder of horror, as he buried his face in his palms
and began earnestly to pray for divine deliverance.</p>

<p>“Is this you, Sam,” asked a kindly voice at his ear. “Get
up, Sam,” and a white man who stood behind him took
hold of his arm and said, “Gentlemen, this is a boy that I
know, (they were all “boys,” even if grey-headed) and he
is a harmless boy. He don’t belong to the militia nohow.
I’ll be responsible for him,” and he led him away.</p>

<p>Alfred Minton was now called for, but no response
came.</p>

<p>“Alf Minton! Alf Minton!” was repeated with oaths
and imprecations, and still no response.</p>

<p>The committee entered the ring, and touched each man
upon his head, asking, “Who’s this?”</p>

<p>At last a small, sick, weakly-looking young man acknowledged
the name.</p>

<p>For the credit of human nature be it recorded that one
of the mob begged that the poor, sick boy be let alone;
and others were evidently tiring of bloodshed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>But the majority were not yet satiated, and with profanity,
they shouted, “O, we’ll fix him! We’ll <i>cure him</i>!” and
they led him also away. The guns fired; the crowd returned;
but Alfred did not.</p>

<p>During this execution another white man conveyed
Friend Robbins away; learning which, when too late to interfere,
some of the more sanguinolent ran up to headquarters
with complaints; but the moving spirits there having
had their own desires for revenge measurably satisfied,
and despairing of the arrest of Captain Doc; and perhaps,
the inflaming effects of their potations beginning to wane,
they began to think of possible court scenes in the future.
So they were but indifferent listeners, and even suggested
the possibility of some other method of disposing of the
remaining captives.</p>

<p>Pompey Conner, a noted thief and gambler, whose skill
at cards had often taxed the purses of some of this fastidious
throng of captors was the next called at the “dead
ring.”</p>

<p>“Pompey you <i>run</i>,” whispered Mann Harris, who sat beside
him.</p>

<p>Pompey was a powerful man, when he chose to exert his
strength, and he darted through the crowd like an arrow;
stooping a little, and with his brawny shoulder cleaving
his way.</p>

<p>When he reached a clear track, numerous shots followed,
and the mob thinking him severely wounded jeered and
shouted triumphantly; while he crouched behind a tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
rolled his great eyes, nodded his woolly head, and muttered
audibly as he turned up the leg of his trousers, “It only
just scalped my leg, af’er all.”</p>

<p>“What better fun do you want than that, boys? This <i>is</i>
fun! ha! ha! ha! Let’s let ’em all go, and shoot after ’em
like rabbits,” cried a mere boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! you’ve done enough for to-night. Now let
these prisoners go.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let these prisoners go,” chimed in another.</p>

<p>“Let’s pile ’em up like frogs and shoot into ’em,” said
another, with an oath that should make the blood curdle;
while still another said, “No don’t do that, but let ’em go
and don’t shoot after ’em.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we ought not to leave none to tell the tale. Let’s
kill ’em all!”</p>

<p>“We came out for <i>fun</i>; now let’s have it, and not give up
so,” said a very young man, a minor.</p>

<p>“If we kill them all, there’ll be nobody left to tell the
tale; and if we leave anybody, they’ll go and testify
against us; and I tell you we might as well make a sure
thing of this,” was repeatedly reiterated.</p>

<p>“Oh, let them go,” said a new speaker. “Let us swear
them before they go, not to tell anybody, nor anything
about it.”</p>

<p>After much discussion, this counsel prevailed.</p>

<p>“Now all you &mdash;&mdash; black rascals you, get up here,” said
Captain Sweargen.</p>

<p>The prisoners quickly obeyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, you all get down again, on your knees, and hold
up your right hands.”</p>

<p>All obeyed. “I solemnly swear,” said the Captain, “I
solemnly swear,” repeated the prisoners, “that I will never
go into any court to testify, [repeated] nor to know anything
about this affair, nor what has been done in Baconsville
this evening, nor to-night, nor that I know any of
the men who was in the party.”</p>

<p>The prisoners all took the oath.</p>

<p>“Now, you &mdash;&mdash; rascals, get away from here!”</p>

<p>Each sprung to his feet, and all but two ran for life.
Corporal Free dodged behind a tree, and Mann Harris,
who was on the edge of the dusky group, stood still.</p>

<p>Fifteen or twenty of the irrepressible “chivalry” leveled
their guns upon the liberated prisoners whom the South
Carolina rifle clubs had captured from the National Guards,
and fired; “just like they was shooting at birds.”</p>

<p>As evidence of the skill of these riflemen it may be mentioned
that but one of those colored men was wounded,
and he but slightly, though the firing was at fifteen paces.</p>

<p>“Mann Harris, where do you live?” asked a maimed
relic of the confederate service.</p>

<p>“I live right on the corner opposite Dan Lemfield’s.”</p>

<p>“Well, you go on home.”</p>

<p>“I can’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t you?”</p>

<p>“I’m afeard to go through them men by myself.”</p>

<p>“Come on, I’ll go with you.” So that one-armed white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
man sat upon his horse, and the great muscular negro
walked beside it, holding upon the saddle for protection.
They passed from Market into Cook street, and wended
their way among the slowly dissolving crowd.</p>

<p>Nearing Mercer street, the escort began to converse.
“Well, Mann, now you see what the result is when niggers
vote against the white people.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” replied the
colored man.</p>

<p>“Have you always voted?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I has; I voted the ’publican ticket all the time.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t intend to say you want to vote it?”</p>

<p>“If this fuss is about, I sha’n’t vote no kind of a ticket.”</p>

<p>Another horseman on the opposite side of the narrow
street overheard the last remark, and approached.</p>

<p>“Harris, I know you,” said he. “We was boys at the
same time, and have known each other all the while along;
and I know that you are a nigger that has got good sense,
good common sense. You see where this nigger is lying,
here?” [They had just come upon the body of John Carr.]
“Yes, sir; I see him.”</p>

<p>“<i>Well, just so will we lay you, if you ever vote the Republican
ticket again.</i>”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I will not vote no kind of a ticket.”</p>

<p>“No, &mdash;&mdash; that’s the plan,” said the proud Southern,
“and we intend to carry it out; and the only way for you to
save yourself is to come over and vote with us; because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
we know that you know mighty well, when you vote
against us you are voting against your interest.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know it was so much against your interest as
to kill a man,” replied Harris. “I had no idea that it was
any such thing as that.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see what the consequence is, and we’re going
to carry this State, and we intend to do it if we have to
kill every nigger, and this rascally Governor too; he is the
head of all the thieves in the State, and the white people
don’t intend to stand it no longer; they intend to break it
up.”</p>

<p>Harris and his protector then moved on, and soon reached
their place of destination.</p>

<p>“Mann,” said Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, “I’ve got a little talk for you.
I, to-night, by your being recommended to me, saved your
life; and now you can do me a favor, and I will tell you
what it is.”</p>

<p>“All right, Captain. There a’n’t nothing that I could
do that I wouldn’t do for yo’, for yo’ saved my life.”</p>

<p>“Yes; what I want to say to you is, that you don’t know
anything about the affair at all; that they had you around
there, but you knowed nobody; that these are unknown
parties; and if any one comes to get you to go into court to
testify, or say anything about calling anybody’s name, <i>you
don’t know</i>. This time we will let you off; but next time
we get at this thing, we’ll <i>git</i> you. Now I will tell you
as you do me a favor, and don’t you call anybody’s name;
don’t you own to them that you do know; and tell them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the rest of them, not to say anything about it; that you
seen the boys, but you didn’t know who it was. If any
one asks you, tell ’em you don’t know; it was unknown
parties. Good-night;” and his magnanimous benefactor
rode away, and left Mann Harris upon his door-step.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Under</span> cover of the morning fog Captain Doc descended
from the verandah of the Postmaster’s residence. As he
slid down a pillar of the open piazza of the lower story, a
black face stared from one of the lower windows, with an
expression of mingled terror and surprise. Reassured by
a smile upon Doc’s face, he raised the sash cautiously, and
whispered, “Does you want to come in?”</p>

<p>“No, no, Dick!” was the reply, “this town isn’t a safe
enough place to hold me when the day comes. The hounds
will be back again, when they have fed and slept a little.
Have you been there all night?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and all alone too. The family knowed it wa’n’t
safe for ’em here, pertic’lar Mr. Rouse. And so dey left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
me to see after tings. Gen. Baker, nor none of ’em’ dar’n’t
<i>touch dis house</i>, cause the Post Office is yere, and dat’s dee
United States&mdash;they are ’afeared o’ de Yankees you see.
But, oh my! Ha’n’t it been a long night, and a <i>awful one</i>!
’Pears like I’m a hundred yeah old. How many’s been
killed?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Enough, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Dey didn’t git yo’? I’m surprised, Doc.”</p>

<p>“No, nor they won’t;” and waving an adieu to Dick,
the Captain walked noiselessly to the back part of the garden,
and leaped the fence into Mercer street.</p>

<p>There, stiff and stark lay the body of John Carr, the
Town Marshal; and further up, close beside the fence, a
shapeless heap, as it appeared, which Doc knew must be
the body of Moses Parker, whom the slave-catcher had
“got” on the previous evening.</p>

<p>Keeping on towards the hills and near the railroad, he
escaped unobserved; till, when ascending the hill, he heard
his name spoken, quite near him. Though startled for
an instant, he was immediately joined by Ned O’Bran, who
came out from a clump of bushes where he had spent the
night in terror; and, in company, the two men walked to the
county seat, distant nearly twenty miles. There they
found an excited people, and several refugees from the
scene of massacre, among whom was Elder Jackson.</p>

<p>“Phebe,” said Uncle Jesse, early that morning, “I don’t
believe you’d best go up to church to-day. I don’t believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
there’ll be many women there, for I reckon they all would
leave the town last night.”</p>

<p>“And <i>I</i> don’t believe dar’ll be <i>no men</i>, nor no church
nuther; fo’ Eldah Jackson bein a Legislatur man, an’ a
Radical, ’ll have to streak it, yo’ may be sho; fo’ of co’se de
white folks has beat de niggahs, as dey allus does.”</p>

<p>“Well, now, it’s queer; but I never did thought about
the Elder last night? For certain they’ll be after him; for
there’s a political side to this ’ere fuss. Now you git breakfast
just as quick as you can, and I’ll go over and see.”</p>

<p>“I’m afeared to have yo’ go.”</p>

<p>“But somebody ought to see after Elder Jackson.”</p>

<p>“Dat’s so; I wish I could go wid yo’.”</p>

<p>“No, no. Maybe I shall have to escape myself, and
it’s a heap easier to escape on horseback, than it would be
in a wagon, and two of us.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t yo’ best git Den Barden to go ’long, Jesse?”
asked his wife as he arose from his hasty breakfast.</p>

<p>“No, Phebe, I’m just agoing to leave the Laud Jesus
Christ here, to take care of you and the children, and get
God Almighty to go ’long with me, and see after me; and
I’m going to go without anybody else at all.”</p>

<p>So after reading with much needful moderation, and not
without verbal errors, the 69th Psalm, he knelt with his
little family upon the cottage floor, and repeated the
same sentiments from a full heart.</p>

<p>Though not more than three miles from the village in a
direct line, a good five miles or more of circuitous and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
somewhat lonely road lay between Jesse’s home and the
scene of the massacre; and he had ample time for reflection.</p>

<p>He had long maintained, among his neighbors, the only
attitude an unprejudiced lover of justice could; but it had
brought to him alike, confidence and distrust, reverence
and envy, respect and aversion; and while his assistance
and advice were sought by the moderate and by the extremists
on both hands, he scarcely knew whether he had a
friend on whom he could certainly rely, or an enemy who
would betray him. Fortunately his road did not cross the
river, for the city police yet stationed at the bridge still denied
passage to persons of color, though allowing whites
to pass freely.</p>

<p>As he entered the little town, he saw a number of men
moving along the principal street, and evidently carrying
some heavy burden. He did not approach them, but went
directly to Elder Jackson’s house.</p>

<p>He found it deserted, and large charred spots upon the
surface gave evidence that attempts had been made to fire
it; and the garden was trodden down and utterly destroyed.
He then turned toward Springer’s house. This stood back
from the sidewalk, and not without misgivings he entered
the trampled yard, and rapped at the closed door.</p>

<p>Springer answered the summons in person, and greeted
his friend with genuine cordiality.</p>

<p>“Why, brother Jesse, I’m surprised and glad both, to see
you this morning.”</p>

<p>“And I’m thanking the Laud, this minute to find you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
alive, and to get inside the shelter of your house. It ’pears
like the streets is full of ghosts, or something a man’s glad
to get away from. What is going on down street? I seen
’em carrying something into society hall.”</p>

<p>“Come in and set down Brother, Jesse. I suppose they’re
collecting the dead. The Intendant was in here, and wanted
me to go down and see them before they moved ’em&mdash;to go
on the coroner’s jury, in fact; but I told him I couldn’t. I’m
sick. This last night’s job is worse than a fever. You
didn’t come up, Jesse?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t. I couldn’t think it would be right, nor
any good, somehow, and so I staid away. But maybe now
I ought to ha’ come?”</p>

<p>“No, you hadn’t; you’d only been another one. My mother-in-law
is very bad this morning. The scare last night
was enough to kill a well woman, and you know she was
pretty sick and weak before. I guess we’d best go away to
talk. Come right up stairs, and we’ll set and talk all we
want to, and she won’t hear us;” and Mr. Springer took his
guest to a tasteful chamber.</p>

<p>The house was not large, but was well furnished and
neatly kept.</p>

<p>“Where is the Elder?” asked Mr. Roome, when they
were again seated.</p>

<p>“That I don’t know. He may be in the Kingdom of
Glory, but I suppose he left town, and went to the city maybe.
He and Ned O’Bran went off together, and the last I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
saw of him they were going up Main street, making for
Ned’s house.”</p>

<p>“How many is killed, and who be they?”</p>

<p>“Seven killed and two wounded that we know; and
there’s a good many more missing that we don’t know
whether they’re dead or not. Marmor is one o’ them.”</p>

<p>“Marmor? Well, if there was one man in town to be
killed, Marmor would be that man. There ain’t no man in
Baconsville them white democrats want to kill so bad as
they do Marmor, without it is Watta!”</p>

<p>“Watta they’ve got! He’s gone! and I’m afeared they’ve
got Marmor also.”</p>

<p>“<i>Watta’s gone?</i> I <i>knowed</i> he’d be killed!”</p>

<p>“Yes, and Den Pipsie, and Ham Sterns, and John
Carr&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, Springer! You don’t say John Carr is killed?”</p>

<p>“He was the first man they took; then Moses Parker&mdash;&mdash;I
heard them both shot, and knew the voices. Alfred Minton,
he got shot too, but they say he an’t dead yet. Oh,
that makes me remember (rising). His father came here
just before you did, and wanted me to go down there.
They wanted somebody to pray; for he can’t live. I suppose
I must go, but I tell you I can’t bear to. All these
things seem so awful that they make me sick, and I can’t
help it. Won’t you go Jesse? Go down and pray with the
poor fellow.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Lying right there on the ground where they shot him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
last night; and they say somebody has mommucked him up
awfully.”</p>

<p>“Well, Brother Springer, I’ll go, but I want you to go
’long.”</p>

<p>“Do they know who shot him?” asked Uncle Jesse, when
they were on their way.</p>

<p>“It is said to be unknown parties that done all the shooting
from this “dead ring” they had, but there’s one comfort&mdash;the
Lord knows who done it; and He knows who started
the thing, and put these unarmed victims into the hands of
an armed posse big enough to arrest the whole of Aiken
County. There,” (as they reached a point between Dan
Lemfields’ corner, and the railroad trestle-work), “this is
where Moses Parker fell, and laid till an hour ago. You
can see the blood.”</p>

<p>Mr. Roome looked, but did not speak. Passing under
the trestle-work, and advancing a few steps, they came
upon a pool of blood.</p>

<p>“This is where our Town Marshal was shot between
nine and ten o’clock last night. I heard him holler, “Oh,
Lord! Oh, Lord!” twice, before they fired. It was a great
volley, several guns, and I wonder they didn’t some of
’em kill him instantly. He begged mighty hard before
they shot. I heard him.”</p>

<p>The men resumed their walk, turning down Cook street,
and so coming out upon Market street, and then turning
down that.</p>

<p>“There, right there was the “dead ring,” they say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
where they had twenty-five or thirty prisoners, the Lord
knows how long; and finally shot some of ’em, and then
swore the rest not to testify against them, and let ’em
go, and shot after ’em as they went.”</p>

<p>“Brother Springer,” said Uncle Jesse, grasping his
companion’s arm, “don’t tell me no such talk! You
don’t expect I’m going to believe it’s more than an awful
bad dream you’ve had.”</p>

<p>“Did you dream you saw the blood back there? and
there’s four or five dead men in this hall at your left.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact! Nor I didn’t dream the threats I’ve
heard made; but I really thought it was mostly blow
and bluster; half of it any how!”</p>

<p>“So did I, so did I,” replied Springer, “and I wouldn’t
believe, though I seen all these streets thick with armed
men in the evening, that they meant to kill anybody,&mdash;only
to scare the colored people,&mdash;till I heard ’em shoot
John Carr, and then I was scared.”</p>

<p>By this time the two men had passed another street and
an embankment of the lower rail road, and approached a
small group of citizens, both colored and white. Upon
the bare ground, in a great pool of blood, lay the poor boy
Minton, apparently in the last agonies of death. He was
in great distress, and unable to converse at all.</p>

<p>Fire-arms alone had not sufficed for the fiendishness of
his murderers; for blows as with an axe or hatchet, had
gashed his side, broken his ribs, and cut a large piece of
flesh from his thigh. It was a horrible, sickening sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>“Alfred! Alfred!” cried Uncle Jesse, falling upon his
knees at the boy’s head.</p>

<p>“Alfred, who cut you so? Tell us who did it, Alfred;
it makes fury boil all over me!”</p>

<p>A groan was the only response; and then from the depths
of his great heart, so uniformly held in subjection to his
clear reason, and well balanced judgment, Uncle Jesse
poured forth such a prayer as had never been heard by
those spectators before,&mdash;a prayer for the departing soul;
that it, going from this body weltering in blood shed by
murderous hands, might go up to the righteous Judge innocent
of any vengeful or unforgiving spirit;&mdash;a prayer full
of righteous indignation at these atrocious crimes against
his people, and of the spirit which said ‘Father forgive
them, for they know not what they do.’</p>

<p>As he arose from his knees, Sam Pincksney touched his
elbow, and they shook hands in silence. Minton groaned
and seemed to desire a change of position. The father
and brothers turned him upon his back. Another groan, a
quick gasp, a sigh, and death released him from suffering.</p>

<p>Many hands waited to give all needed, assistance and so
Springer invited a few of his neighbors to accompany him
to his house, that Mr. Roome might learn more particulars
of the affair of the previous night.</p>

<p>“Now I want to get a clear idea of this matter as I can
get,” said Uncle Jesse when they were all seated in
Springer’s chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“I can tell you how it begun,” said the host, “but it
will take us all, and more too, to tell how it went on.”</p>

<p>He then narrated the history of the trouble from the
collision on the 4th of the month, up to the time when
General Baker rode to the city across the river, substantially
as the reader already has it.</p>

<p>“All this time while he was gone,” said Springer,&mdash;“about
half an hour,&mdash;armed bodies of men continued to come
into town; and in fact, a portion of them stopped and
threw themselves into line right in front of the house
here. As soon as General Baker got back, they mounted
again, and went up on Mercer and Cook streets, and so on
over to the river there, and there they fell into line. Then
myself and Judge Rives, and Pincksney, and Elder Jackson,
had an interview there with General Baker; and we
asked him if there was anything we could do,&mdash;what was
necessary to bring about peace.</p>

<p>“He said nothing would satisfy him but the surrender
of the men and their arms. The white men were so boisterous
they treated us very badly. One man, Captain
Sweargen, drew his pistol while we were having this interview
with General Baker;&mdash;and really, I thought he
seemed to be looking at me, and that he was going to
shoot; but when he saw me looking at him, he put his
pistol in his pocket again.</p>

<p>“Pincksney was whipped in his face, cut right in, as you
see, and so then we got away as quick as possible.”
“Didn’t the General stop these things?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, not at all. Didn’t appear to notice ’em at all.
Then the firing begun pretty soon down on the river-bank.”</p>

<p>“The white men down there are saying this morning
that it was the Militia that begun the firing,” said Sam
Pincksney.</p>

<p>“No? Why, they can’t say that! It sounded like right
from, the river-bank,” said Tim Grassy, an intelligent-looking
mullato, about thirty years of age, who was a
brother-in-law of Springer.</p>

<p>“Well, <i>I</i> know the <i>white men</i> fired first, for just let
me tell you,” said Ben, a younger brother of Tim Grassy.</p>

<p>“George Hansen was at our warehouse, (Ben was bookkeeper
in Springer’s cotton warehouse,) and he told me
there was going to be trouble, and he wanted me to go up
to his plantation with him, and see his game chickens. But
I told him I couldn’t get off. He told me he saw a great
crowd of white men gathered up back there in the country.
An hour after he left, squads of men commenced coming
in, and half an hour after that I went into the armory for
protection. The white men opened fire and kept it up as
much as fifteen minutes, and maybe half an hour, before
they gave the colored men a <i>chance</i> to fire at all. I know,
for I saw it.”</p>

<p>“Did any white men get killed?”</p>

<p>“One, Merry Walter.”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose some of our people must have killed
him!” said Uncle Jesse, sadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” said Mann Harris, who had sat
quietly listening, though reputed the greatest talker in
Baconsville, “they quarrelled among theirselves, some.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Ben, “but Merry was a Democrat, and I
suppose they wouldn’t want to kill him themselves.”</p>

<p>“I heard some of ’em talking this morning, some respectable-looking
gentlemen from Georgia, and saying that they
had been told that this had been all to break up a nest of
thieves and robbers&mdash;that the people in Baconsville was
that, and that Capt. Doc is a rowdy, and the Militia Company
is a band o’ thieves; and Hanson Baker said that is a
fact and just so.”</p>

<p>“I never heard anything like that in all the years I’ve
lived here,” said Springer, the oldest resident except Uncle
Jesse, who assented to his testimony.</p>

<p>“They talked about Pompey Conner’s robbing market
wagons, and even hauled up that old graveyard affair, more
than three years old; and they know the Republican niggers
are after every thief they know of, and punishes ’em
too. Pompey took his turn in jail, and so did that old
republican nigger that dug them three graves open; the
democratic one got away, but I’ve seen him back just the
other day. I don’t believe they cared anything for the
graves; they only thought there was some money buried
somewhere in the graveyard during the war.”</p>

<p>“That mean democratic nigger that lives over back of
the hill there, was in town yesterday, and some of ’em said
that he told the white folks where to find men&mdash;where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
their houses were, and if that is true it is just contemptible!”
said Springer.</p>

<p>“The fact is,” said Ben, the niggers are getting a bad
name everywhere, with these old white aristocrats, and
especially since this fuss.”</p>

<p>Ben was young, and his honest, expressive face glowed
as he spoke, with animation which subsided immediately
into grave thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>“What has become of Capt. Doc?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know; nobody knows. He’s sharp though, and
I hope he has got away. If they were to get him they
would think he must be drawn and quartered, I expect,”
said Ben.</p>

<p>“Springer, you said Marmor is among the missing?”
said Uncle Jesse.</p>

<p>“We don’t know what has become of him. Old man
Baker was in Dan’s house a good part of the night, Pincksney
says; and the houses join, you know; and the last seen
of Marmor, he was jumping the fence into Dan’s back
yard. Dan’s folks are there this morning, but don’t seem
to want to see nor speak to anybody. There’s a mystery
about it somehow.”</p>

<p>“Dan is a kind of a queer dark man, you know. Jews
mostly is,” said Tim Grassy.</p>

<p>“Dan is a likely sort of fellow,” said Mr. Roome, “I
wish he didn’t sell so much whiskey.”</p>

<p>“Between twelve and one o’clock,” resumed the host,
“I heard Col. Baker (at least I took it to be his voice).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Some of them just opposite here had said the house was
afire, and I heard him sing out to the crowd, ‘Put that
fire out! nothing like that shall go on; I don’t want any
burning.’ Soon after that I heard firing again, and I heard
somebody else holler. I don’t know who it was, but I suppose
it was Moses Parker.”</p>

<p>“Who shot him?”</p>

<p>“That I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Where was Watta killed? Poor fellow! I knowed
he’d be killed, if anybody was.”</p>

<p>“Down at the ‘dead-ring,’” said Harris, who then gave
the account the reader has had, and continued, “When I
stepped into my house I stepped right onto some of my
wife’s clothes. They had taken ’em all out of the bureau,
and flung ’em all over the floor, broke open three large
trunks I had, and taken away every rag of clothing I had,
and my wife’s bran new dress that she had made very
fancy to be baptized in next month&mdash;had never had it on&mdash;they
taken that away, and her watch and chain, and all her
jewelry, and all my clothes; and taken a pin of mine
that didn’t cost me but sixty-five dollars; and I don’t suppose
some of them fellers ever had sixty-five dollars in
their lives; and I told Pick. Baker so this morning. Just
so; and he said it was some of the factory crowd from the
city, none o’ his men hadn’t done it. I said I don’t know;
I seen some of his men looked pretty bad too, and I
thought they’d take things just as quick as anybody.</p>

<p>“He says, ‘Well, there’s bad men in all crowds.’ Everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
in my house is broken up. They carried off all my
lamps and such things, tore down my curtains, broke my
dishes, and carried off what they couldn’t break&mdash;all the
victuals and everything. When I told Gaston so this
morning, he offered me twenty-five cents to get me something
to eat, and I told him I thanked him. They just
walked right over my wife’s clothes, and spit on ’em.”</p>

<p>“Harris, what do you suppose they did all this for?”</p>

<p>“Well, they said before it happened that I would see the
white people intended to carry the state democratic, and I
expect this is to intimidate us. Hanson Baker told me
last night, (or this morning it was) when I was going home
after they done killed the men that was lying there; and I
asked them how they intended to carry the State Democratic,
and they said, ‘You see there? Well, that’s the
way we’ll lay you just so, if ever you vote the Republican
ticket again;’ and I said, ‘If that’s the way you’re going
on, I an’t a going to vote nohow. I’m done voting,’ and
they said, ‘You’d better be done voting, unless you vote
the Democratic ticket.”</p>

<p>The whole company accepted this view of the motives
of the rioters.</p>

<p>“They didn’t disturb you, Springer?” asked Uncle Jesse.
“You didn’t finish.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he resumed, “this shooting and hollering and
setting fires and so on, continued till the hours I named;
and when they got through killing those they wanted to,
or could get, the crowd commenced going away. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
could hear them passing out in different directions, hollering
and cursing and cavorting around, and saying what
they had done. They would swear and say that they had
got Baconsville all right now; thought they had killed a
sufficient number to prevent nigger-rule any longer in the
county&mdash;thought they had put a quietus on nigger-rule in
the county for all time to come. They went on hollering
and calling the names of the men they had killed; and one
would say, ‘He don’t answer,’ and another would say,
‘He’s looking at the moon and don’t wink his eyes,’ and
they went on making sport of the men they had killed,
and cursing all the time.</p>

<p>Then they commenced robbing, and you could hear it
all over town. It looked like they had parted themselves
up into squads for that business. You could hear them go
to a man’s store, and burst it open and go in, all along the
streets. They broke open my warehouse, and destroyed all
my books and papers, and tore up the floors and partitions&mdash;well,
just ransacked the place entirely. Then they came
here. I had become alarmed at that time, and said to these
young men who were here with me, ‘I think it is best for
us not to remain in this building, I think they will come
here.’ Up to that time I was basing an opinion that they
would not come here, upon the part that I had taken in the
whole affair during the day. I felt that it would keep me
out of danger; but then I saw very readily that even General
Baker had lost all control over the men, and I became
alarmed, and thought best to leave the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>I thought probably they would not interfere with my
wife; but if <i>we</i> were found here, they would kill us. Sure
enough, I suppose we hadn’t any more than got out of the
house and passed round from the front to the back side,
before we heard the footsteps of them passing up the front
steps. I was then behind the house, and there was a light
in my wife’s bedroom, and I saw one of the men in that
room. I didn’t recognize him, though I heard him very
distinctly ask her where I was, and where Benny was. She
told him that she didn’t know where I was; that I had gone
away somewhere. They then commenced ransacking the
house; and they took a couple of shot guns I had here,
and carried them off; and they did use some very abusive
words to my wife. That’s the extent of what occurred
here.”</p>

<p>“No, that’s not quite all, Sam,” said Tim Grassy. “They
asked my sister, who is staying with my mother who is
sick, you know, they asked her where was Springer’s
money? She told them they didn’t have any. They told
her she was a cursed liar. I heard that distinctly, for I felt
uneasy about my sick mother, and crept back close up to
the window. They staid there some time, and we heard
them coming down, and I jumped over in Mrs. Dunn’s yard
opposite her cow house, and stayed there till I knowed all
of them was gone.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose we all go down to the hall and see the
bodies of the dead, and then I must go home,” said Uncle
Jesse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The six men walked slowly down to the old warehouse,
which had been reconstructed into a hall for the use of the
various secret societies of the village, of which the people
of the South are so fond.</p>

<p>There arranged in a row, were the bodies of five men;
all murdered for possessing greater or less proportions of
African blood, and being true to the National Government
which gave them freedom&mdash;nothing more nothing less.</p>

<p>But for these it had been no crime to pass ordinances
protective of the public peace and convenience, or to enforce
them&mdash;no crime to be an intelligent leader among
one’s fellows&mdash;no crime to practice in the use of arms under
sanction of law and the nation’s flag.</p>

<p>The homes of these men had been completely sacked,
and not a whole chair or table was left in some, on which
to lay a coffin, though the wife in one had given her only
bed, a poor stack of straw, to ease the removal of wounded
Merry Walter to his home across the river.</p>

<p>The body of the highly respected and beloved Watta was
in his home, where a distracted widow knelt beside it comfortless;
and two fatherless little ones clung to her skirts,
and wept in sympathy, though ignorant of the magnitude
of their loss.</p>

<p>A large number of spectators thronged the hall and vicinity,
among whom were many white people from the adjoining
State of Georgia. Blacks were still denied passage
by the A&mdash; police.</p>

<p>“How many were wounded?” asked one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Three colored and one white!”</p>

<p>“Talk about Georgia! Talk about Georgia?” said he.</p>

<p>“It’s all this Captain Doc and his lawless band,” said
another Georgian. “This Baconsville is an awful place,” he
continued, regardless of the presence, shrieks and wailings
of the families of the slain, except as he must needs pause
occasionally for the sounds to subside, that he might be
heard. “They are all a set of thieves. It’s a very Sodom!”</p>

<p>“There’s no more of that kind of doings here than in
any other place in the South,” said a third, “the fact is
there a’n’t more than forty-five or fifty white persons live in
this village, and the Bakers and Gaston and them, think
they shouldn’t be responsible to any laws passed by <i>colored
men</i>, and think it is an outrage if they or other white folks
are arrested for violating them; and the niggers have
mostly let them do as they pleased, which has made the exceptions
seem personal and harder to stand.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, it’s likely the niggers don’t waste
any love on old Bob, as they naturally can’t forget how he
got his property; and it is likely there’s all the envious feelings
the poor are apt to have against the rich, besides,
which makes their overbearing ways and impositions, and
violations of town ordinances seem more offensive; and it’s
possible they take offence sometimes when none is intended;
maybe it is so on both sides, though the niggers are not
<i>naturally</i> suspicious, we know. It’s just an envious, suspicious
village, with overbearing and suspicious white
neighbors.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s a little more than that too,” said another man.
“Here’s a State with a big nigger majority on election
days, and a county with a bigger one; and a State and
national campaign a coming, and it’s the centennial, and
the nigger ‘gush’ is tantalizing to them that don’t want a
union with the North, unless they can control it; and the
whites naturally want to begin the next hundred years with
the State in their hands.”</p>

<p>“Oh, fol-de-rol-dol! The superior race <i>ought</i> to rule.
That’s the whole of it,” said another.</p>

<p>“All that doesn’t make this right,” said the first speaker.
“The whites have had the best chance to be civilized, and
the negroes have <i>never done anything</i> like this. Talk
about Georgia! Georgia has never been guilty of such a
barbarous thing as this, and had it not been for those
Bean Island men, it never would have happened.”</p>

<p>“<i>That stirs fury all over one, sir</i>; to have that said after
I have strove so hard to keep things quiet in Bean Island!”
said Uncle Jesse, “I shall inquire about that;” and scarcely
bidding a hasty adieu to his friends, he abruptly left the
place, and mounting his horse, rode home, and hastened to
the residence of Deacon Atwood.</p>

<p>“Deacon,” said he, “a very nice gentleman from Georgia
says that had it not been for Bean Island people, that them
men would never have been killed.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie! It’s a lie!” cried the Deacon, “and if they
go on talking that way, the whole cat will be let out at
once. There an’t a word of truth in it! There wa’n’t a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Bean Island man shot a gun. Dr. Ava and Joe Ennery
guarded the prisoners, and when they were to be killed,
they were to be delivered into the hands of unknown parties
that the law couldn’t detect them. That was a plan
laid before. They didn’t fire a gun there, nor kill a man;
<i>not one!</i> There was nobody stayed over there from Bean
Island, but some drunken fellows that couldn’t get away;
and if they keep on talking in that way, the whole cat will
get out of the water.”</p>

<p>“Deacon Atwood, that was wrong then. You ought
never to have killed them men after taking them prisoners.”</p>

<p>Dea. A.&mdash;“I agree with you there.”</p>

<p>Uncle Jesse.&mdash;“They ought not to have killed them
after they stopped fighting.”</p>

<p>Dea. A.&mdash;“They ought never to have stopped fighting
till they killed them <i>in the fight</i>!”</p>

<p>Uncle Jesse.&mdash;“They didn’t kill any of them in the
fight; they must have been very poor marksmen, as many
as they was there, and couldn’t kill anybody, and had to
wait till they got out of ammunition, and then took ’em
out and killed ’em. Why didn’t they let ’em be taken by
the law, and be tried and had justice done ’em?”</p>

<p>Dea. A.&mdash;“I suppose the men were so ambitious that
they didn’t intend they should live. Now I tell you, Jesse,
what this Georgia gentleman said, isn’t so. Bardon Ramol
and Bob Blending met a young nigger this morning just
before they got to Horse Creek, a coming home, and Bardon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
he says to him, ‘Now, don’t you go down there.
Didn’t you hear the guns down there last night? The last
one is killed, and it’s all over, and it an’t worth while to
go.’”</p>

<p>Uncle Jesse.&mdash;“And so they got him to turn back?
That’s well enough, but not much.”</p>

<p>Dea. A.&mdash;“Yes. Now they’re accusing Sam Payne, and
Tad Volier&mdash;that little fellow not more’n four feet high&mdash;to
day, and I’ll swear it’s a lie; for them men were not
killed by anybody that is on this side the river.”</p>

<p>Jesse Roome did not tell his neighbor how well all this
conversation assured him that he was privy to all the
plans, at least; but simply asked, “Sam Payne was not
there?”</p>

<p>Dea. A.&mdash;“No, Jesse, he wasn’t there.”</p>

<p>Uncle Jesse.&mdash;“Well, Deacon Atwood, I’ve always been
a good friend to you, and I’ve told you some things that
the colored people were going to do that was wrong, and
we have been pretty confidential a great many times; but
I just tell you, sir, if you go to violating the law, then I’ll
back down. I will not stick for anybody that will violate
the law. My motto is to punish every man, white or
black, that will violate the law.”</p>

<p class="pr4">&mdash;<span class="smcap">King Richard III.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">When</span> Col. Baker ordered Mrs. Marmor to leave her
home, she would not ask shelter in the house of her nearest
neighbor&mdash;that most Christian Jew, Dan Lemfield&mdash;lest
her presence might jeopardise the safety of her husband;
and she stood upon the doorsteps with her infant in her
arms, and little Louie beside her, gazing up and down the
street in utter dismay, and not knowing whither to flee.
Only a few steps at her left was the drill-room, the centre
about which all the warlike preparations were arranged,
and every dwelling in the beleaguered square, except her
own and Lemfield’s, was the abode of at least one colored
family, and therefore clearly unsafe.</p>

<p>“Where is my papa? Why don’t he come and go with
us, mamma?” asked the little boy in the piping voice of
childish grief.</p>

<p>“Hush, child! Mamma’s glad he is not here. Keep
still and maybe the soldiers won’t hurt us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will they hurt us maybe, mamma?” The boy now
began to wail piteously, and the babe cried in sympathy.</p>

<p>“Hush, Louie! Mamma will tell you,” said Mrs. Marmor.
She sat down upon the steps, in presence of the
armed foe by which the street was occupied, and, placing
her own person in range of any possible shot that might be
aimed at Marmor’s boy, she spoke in low and rapid tones:&mdash;</p>

<p>“If you cry, these men will see you; and if you keep
still, maybe they won’t notice, and sister will keep still too.
You don’t want little sister to get hurt. You will be a
brave man, like papa, won’t you? Papa isn’t afraid, and
he keeps still.”</p>

<p>Pressing both his little hands over his mouth for an
instant, and choking back one or two great sobs, the child
looked up into his mother’s eyes, smiling through his tears,
and repeated&mdash;“I cried unto God with my voice, even unto
God with my voice, and he gave ear unto me. Mamma,
there’s Mr. Dan. See! Mamma, see!”</p>

<p>Turning, she saw the Jew at his door, beckoning her
with earnest gesticulation, although beside him stood the
burly Rufus Baker. As she approached, she heard Mr.
Lemfield say something about hostages, and Baker replied
with a significant wink and nod.</p>

<p>“We will all die together, if we must,” said the distressed
wife and mother, mentally.</p>

<p>“Co im, Mrs. Marmor. Co im,” said Lemfield. “Don’t
sthop out here mit de leetle kinder. You huspand go vay?
Dat ish pad. May pe he’ll come.” A quick glance at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
shrewd face, and she accepted his invitation, and entered
the hospitable door with her little ones.</p>

<p>Dan soon followed, and taking her aside, said hastily,
“You must not tell. You pe like you know not vare de
man ist. I tink I co get old Bob and feed ’im viskey. Ven
he trunk he shleeps much, and vants more viskey. He pe
here he not tink you huspand be here; and ve knows he pe
killing no mon. Now you take care.”</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Marmor took the cue quickly.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after this the first gun fired. The
Jew flew to the front door, and soon returned accompanied
by the great bushy-whiskered negro-hunter, who was much
excited.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marmor feigned great uneasiness and anxiety for
the safety of her husband, and could but shudder under the
piercing eye of the old man, while Louie hid behind her
chair and peeped out at him with the fascination of fear.</p>

<p>Their host seemed to forget the presence of his other
guests in his solicitude for Mr. Baker’s comfort.</p>

<p>“You not pe vell I see. Dat ish pad. Vat ish te matter?”</p>

<p>“I’m excited, and I reckon I’ve taken cold. Give me
some whiskey,” replied the hypochondriac. “I’ve sweat too
much. The day has been terribly hot!”</p>

<p>“Ya. Dat ish goot. Col. Paker tole me shut up mine
par; but I not open it to serve you. I shust pring it here,
and you trink mit my family. Vill I make shling? oder
toddy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“O sling, sling.”</p>

<p>“Alle right. Dat ish goot;” and Dan bustled away to
the bar-room and brought a bottle of strong liquor, from
which he soon mixed what he called “de ferry pest shling
eber made in de country,” and with great show of solicitude
presented it to the old man, who gulped it down and
smacked his lips with evident satisfaction.</p>

<p>In common with all mankind Robert Baker had an impressible
point; and, as with every other tyrant, that point
was vulnerable to flattery. By a discreet use of this depletive,
and a vigorous administration of sling, and industrious
cultivation of his hypochondriacal tendency, the Jew
soon had him upon his back, and courting a perspiration
which should relieve him of numerous imaginary ills. The
rapid discharge of firearms upon the street, however, kept
the patient nervous and excited; and Dan’s family screamed
and exclaimed, and Mrs. Marmor and her boy wept silently
as volley followed volley.</p>

<p>“Where is my papa?” Louie sobbed into his mother’s
ear; for to him “old man Baker” was an ogre, who would
devour any little boy he chanced to observe.</p>

<p>“Let us pray God to take care of him. He is taking care
of <i>us</i>. See, little sister is asleep.”</p>

<p>“What makes you cry, mamma?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just hear the guns? Somebody will get hurt,”
and they wept and trembled together, while Lemfield continued
to ply his patient with whiskey, till even his eagerness
for the fray could not master the oncoming stupor of
drunkenness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>Two hours or more passed thus, and it was dark, when
fearful yells burst out, curdling the blood of every listener.
They were like the jubilations of demons, and were soon
followed by the booming of cannon.</p>

<p>Couriers brought frequent advices of the progress of affairs,
which Lemfield carefully received for the old man,
and as carefully withheld from every occupant of the house
except the refugee in the chamber.</p>

<p>At the sound of the artillery, Baker rolled from the
sofa, and gleefully exclaiming, “We’ll get ’em now &mdash;&mdash;
them!” he reeled from the front to the rear door, pistol
in hand, chafing under the restraint of his self-appointed
nurse, like a hound in the leash when the horn of the
huntsmen is heard.</p>

<p>A tramping sound in the back yard drew both men to
the door.</p>

<p>“Who ish dat?” demanded Dan, peering into the darkness
of a shady part of the enclosure.</p>

<p>“There goes a &mdash;&mdash; nigger! Here he goes! Here he
goes!” shouted the old slave-catcher.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!” cried the Jew; but while
he yet spoke it was too late.</p>

<p>“I’ve got ’im! I’ve got ’im!” cried the old man, running
to his fallen game.</p>

<p>“Co im quick! Co im quick, Meester Paker! Somebody
vill shoot <i>you</i>,” and the excited little man caught the
murderer’s arm and dragged him into the house, while
the dusky form of Nat Wellman crept on all fours into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
a yard still further to the rear, and found safety in a
deeper shade.</p>

<p>Filled with such terrors the night wore on, and Marmor’s
were not the only infants that sobbed themselves to sleep
in the midst of those dreadful alarms, though many were
laid in the shadows of the cornfields or the dampness of the
swamps that surrounded the besieged town.</p>

<p>“<i>Ich vill make ine shling, vat vill make</i> Old Bob <i>shleep,
so Ich vill</i>!” muttered Dan, as he mixed a few drops of
laudanum with a fresh mug of the steaming beverage. “Ich
hab no more mens killed by mine house.”</p>

<p>The patient was at length awakening great echoes in his
bed room, with his stentorian breathings, notwithstanding
renewed disturbances upon the premises, and that most
Christian Jew stole up to Marmor’s retreat.</p>

<p>“For your life, Meester Marmor, do co hide somevare!
Dey pe hunt you, and say dey vill purn your house. Dey
shware dey vill hab you. Dey say you be ine &mdash;&mdash; scallavag,
ine republican, and dat you pringht ammunition to
de nigger militia.”</p>

<p>“It is false!” said Marmor, “the only ammunition I ever
brought to this town is republican newspapers.”</p>

<p>“Dat make no odds. Dat pad ’nough, dey tink, and dey
pe hunt you; dey co tru mine house shust now. Dey find
Shimmy’ (Jimmy, Marmor’s servant) in yo’ yard, and dey
vip ’im to tell vo you ist; but he know notting.”</p>

<p>The hunted man fled to the house top, where he lay long,
listening to the crashing of his printing presses and furniture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and the shrieks and cries of colored women and children
whom he saw violently dragged from their houses by
fiendish men athirst for the blood of their husbands and
fathers for whom they sought; and wondering if his own
mother was suffering similar indignities, he blamed himself
for hiding.</p>

<p>He saw houses fired, in various directions, but the flames
were soon extinguished by the less reckless of the assailants,
or by the occupants, some of whom were thus captured.</p>

<p>About two o’clock in the morning the tumult in his own
house was renewed and increased; and, driven from their
hiding place there, two colored men leaped from a window
of the second story, upon a roof beneath it, and with almost
superhuman effort, climbed upon that of a higher
part of the building, and scarcely less miraculously escaped
death by the pistol of their friend Marmor, who mistook
them for foes.</p>

<p>“For mercy’s sake don’t shoot!” cried one, just in time to
arrest a second discharge.</p>

<p>The three men lay flat upon the roof to avoid discovery,
but the sound of the pistol and the voice had betrayed
them, and several of the rioters attempted to follow the
young men.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the three men slipped down through the
scuttle into Lemfield’s house.</p>

<p>Obliged to abandon pursuit in that direction, the ruffians
re-entered the window, descended to the street, and pouring
into the next house, rushed to the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>“Vas fur you co up mine shtair? Co town! Ich say, co
town!” cried Dan. “Ich been goot freund to <i>ebery man</i>,
so you shall not break mine tings. You must go vay,
mine vamily pe sick up dar, and you will schare mine cronk
poy so he co todt!” and pushing past them, he mounted
the upper steps, still persisting in his opposition, and obstructing
the way.</p>

<p>“<i>Ich no niggah, no’ publican, no notting dat votes’ cainst
you. So you co vay!</i>”</p>

<p>“We won’t hurt you, nor your family, Dan, if we find
you all right, but, (the reader must imagine the vilest and
most profuse epithets and profanity), Louis Marmor is up
there, and we <i>will have him</i>. He’s a scallawag, and a republican,
and is helping the niggers, and we must get him.
He has got to die as well as the rest.”</p>

<p>“Er nicht dar.”</p>

<p>“You’re a lying Jew dog!”</p>

<p>“Ich schvare youns, Louis Marmor ist not pout mine
blace, <i>py de beard of Abraham</i>!”</p>

<p>“You swear to that, do you?” asked the leader.</p>

<p>“Ich schware! Ich schware!”</p>

<p>“B-o-y-s, b-o-y-s,” said old man Baker, staggering from
the couch where Mrs. Marmor had shaken him into consciousness,
“Boys, oh, come back! come, come, come back!
Dan’s a good fellow. I’m quite unwell, quite unwell,”
drawled he, “and he has taken care of me and pro&mdash;pro&mdash;protected
me from them &mdash;&mdash; niggers, and I’ll protect his
house and family. Now just come back. Don’t go up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
there. I’ve been here all night, so far, and hide nor hair o’
Louis Marmor ha’n’t been seen about here. I’ll vouch for
<i>this</i> house, and guard it too. So don’t go up.”</p>

<p>“If you say so, Mr. Baker, we’ll come back, but we
thought he was thar sho’.”</p>

<p>“Ha’n’t been about here to-night. I’ve been here and
could see, and Dan’s all right.”</p>

<p>The ruffians yielded, and the three men, who had been
unable to reach the scuttle and escape, were saved; though,
confident of a speedy return of their foes, the colored men
immediately sought another place of concealment.</p>

<p>The cries and pleadings of another captive were soon
afterwards heard in the back-yard, and he was conveyed in
triumph to the “dead-ring” which was still insatiable
while ungraced by the persons of Marmor and Doc.</p>

<p>Though the house was not again entered by the mob, so
strong and general was the suspicion that Mr. Marmor was
upon the Jew’s premises, that after his return to his home
even Robert Baker was persuaded to believe it, and a vigilant
watch was maintained several days thereafter.</p>

<p>While Aunt Phœbe was hastening the preparation of
Uncle Jesse’s breakfast the next morning, Jane Marmor
sat beside her husband in the Jew’s chamber, and described
the condition of things, as she had found them in their
home; for she had already ventured there, and had looked
in upon her mother-in-law, who had locked herself into her
own little shop, and remained there, alone, and (strangely),
unharmed, through the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry Gaston, and Hanson, Tommy, and old man Baker
relieved each other on watch all the next day, each being
assisted by a band of trusted followers; and Marmor,
close behind Dan’s window-shades, listened to their threats
against himself, and their attempts to convince such
negroes as ventured near them, that he, Kanrasp, and
the “carpet-bag Governor,” were solely responsible for the
massacre; and while his colored friends were anxiously
conjecturing his fate, his experiences in the affair had
scarcely begun.</p>

<p>As the day declined, Mrs. Marmor joined her entreaties
to those of their host, urging upon her husband the necessity
of attempting escape, as there were indications of
more decided search of the premises.</p>

<p>Night came at length, and spread her dark mantle over
the village; but the hunted man had scarcely escaped the
house when the rising of the full moon made concealment
almost impossible.</p>

<p>As the weather was very warm, and he must make speed,
he went without a coat. Choosing a time when the sentry
had passed to the extreme of his beat, he walked up the
street with apparently careless moderation, hoping to be
mistaken for a laborer, and to reach a small station on the
railroad three miles distant, before the arrival of the next
train.</p>

<p>This he accomplished in safety, but arrived too early.</p>

<p>A congregation was gathering at a church near by,
for the Sunday evening service; and as his lips were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
parched with thirst, he approached and procured a drink
of water.</p>

<p>Several persons there knew Marmor, but as he had shaved
his beard, and otherwise slightly disguised himself, they
were not confident of his identity.</p>

<p>However, on his return to the carriage-road, he was at
once confronted by six armed men.</p>

<p>The click of their gun-locks was his first intimation of
their presence, and with the bound of a wild deer, he dashed
into a black swamp hard by.</p>

<p>His pursuers were mounted, and therefore could not enter
it; but the swamp, though over a mile long, was narrow;
and they hunted him on either side.</p>

<p>It was a cane-break, and but for the extreme drought of
the season, would have furnished but poor footing indeed.</p>

<p>The tall, stiff reeds reached far above his head, and some
skill was needful to break them over with the font and thus
secure a standing-place. His hat was soon knocked off by
a shot, and his low-quartered shoes lost in the mire. At
length a place was reached where a point of firm land extended
into the swamp, and on this several of his pursuers
took position, (for their number had been increased), to
cut him off, should he attempt to pass.</p>

<p>They had lost sight of him, but as he approached he distinctly
saw Robert Baker directly opposite and facing
him, and not far distant. He noted the resolute bearing
and determined visage of the old hunter; but felt himself
still incompetent to fully sympathize with the hunted slave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of the former times; whom no arm in the State or nation
was strong enough to deliver from his master, or this hired
hunter and his blood-hounds.</p>

<p>But, having little time for sentiment or reflection, he
took a hasty survey of the positions of such of his pursuers
as were in sight, deliberately approached the edge of the
swamp, took aim at the old hunter, who he felt sure would
not scruple to take <i>his</i> life, and firing, ran rapidly in a direction
he thought they would not suspect; and thus escaped
for the time.</p>

<p>But, instead of approaching the town as he intended to
do, he wandered in a circuitous direction, and returned to
the church.</p>

<p>The services were over, and as he saw that many of the
men were mounting horses, he retreated to the woods again,
where he lay till morning.</p>

<p>His pursuers inquired of the worshippers, and finally got
upon his track the next morning, bringing their trained
dogs. From that time till Wednesday morning they
chased him up and down the woods and swamps. His feet
were wounded and swollen, his bare head exposed to the
burning July sun, and he had eaten nothing since Sunday
morning.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning he became desperate, and resolved
to leave the swamp. He did so, and ran along the road.
On several occasions the dogs were upon him when he
again intrenched himself among bushes surrounded by
water, and lay watching, pistol in hand. But as he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
ammunition besides that in his revolver, he determined to
make that as useful as possible, and reserved for a probable
extremity.</p>

<p>Once they caught sight of him at two hundred yards distance
and cried. “There he is! There’s the &mdash;&mdash; scallawag!”
and hissed their dogs upon him.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning he eluded them and reached the
residence of the Intendant of Baconsville, on the outskirts
of the town. He was a pitiable object indeed; with clothing
torn and covered with mud, feet bare, swollen and
bleeding; fair broad brow burned to a blister, auburn hair,
unkempt; famished, fainting, and only his determined energy
left of his former self.</p>

<p>Refreshed by a cup of coffee and a judicious breakfast,
and a bath for his feet, he hobbled to his home, which he
reached about ten o’clock.</p>

<p>It had become his sole wish to see his family once more,
and if he must die, to die with them; and his apprehensiveness
had become so great that he with great difficulty
persuaded to tarry at his neighbors for food. To be driven
from home, and hunted through swamps and forests, like
a ferocious beast, had become an insupportable thought.</p>

<p>And wherefore <i>was</i> he?</p>

<p>Because he sought through that great instrument of enlightenment,
the press, to disseminate his political opinions,
and the principles of a Republican government, and to
strengthen and perpetuate the Union.</p>

<p>An hour after reaching home he became aware that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
foe was on his track and approaching, but the house was
kept closed, and guarded by leading citizens, and he
remained till the afternoon of the following day; when, so
disguised as to be unrecognized by familiar friends, he
took the railroad train for the Capitol, and escaped.</p>

<p>A band of those white ruffians boarded the train, and
passed through it several times, enquiring for him, and
even propounded their questions to him, without recognizing
him.</p>

<p>The horrors of this massacre were but the commencement
of a succession which blackened the history of the
political campaign of the year 1876 in the State of South
Carolina, and in other Southern states, and disgraced the
Republic in the sight of the nations she had invited to
witness the successes she had achieved under a free and
popular government.</p>

<p>Is it asked what punishment was meted out to those
miserable offenders?</p>

<p>They were arrested, liberated for several months under
bail of $500 each, and clearly convicted upon trial; but
because the jury of twelve was empanelled upon a strictly
party basis, and the six white men were <i>avowedly</i> opposed
to conviction on any evidence, a mistrial ensued.</p>

<p>As under “the conciliation policy” of the national administration
which followed the next subsequent election,
the United States’ troops which had been sent into the
State at the request of the Governor were withdrawn,
the defeated Democratic candidates for Governor and Legislature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
supported by the unchartered and hence illegal
rifle clubs usurped the State government, and all further
proceedings against the rioters were dropped, and the
notorious General Baker was elected to a seat in the Senate
of the nation, by that spurious legislature of his State.</p>

<p>Such is the justice, and such the tender mercies, to which
have been consigned the emancipated slaves of the Southern
States, and these and similar experiences have caused
the “Exodus” of the freedmen to the great north-west.</p>

<p>With such fearful odds, can the reader wonder at their
seeming timidity?</p>

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
